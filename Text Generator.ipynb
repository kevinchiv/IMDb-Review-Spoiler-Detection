      " have been given two. Even he said, \"I won't be taking care of him for this book. But, no matter what I need him to do - or at worst, just do it. He deserves it for it being a perfect way to start the story and a great introduction to Tolkien's vast writings.This will be a trilogy of action thrillers, a fantastic adventure and a fantastic story that will be enjoyed for generations to come.\"The Return of the King is an epic, one of the greatest films ever made.\"\"\"As Peter Jackson said, 'this is the pinnacle of cinematic entertainment', and it is no mere achievement.\" The director of Lord of the Rings was a man of extraordinary talent and courage, and with his skill, determination and determination he succeeded to the greatest extent that we might hope for. He was able to use his time to develop a number of remarkable characters that he became more and more recognized, and he became more and more loved as well, to the delight of generations to come.I am glad that Jackson has received so much, which could be expected from anyone, and I hope that this is just that to others, for they will understand and appreciate the wonderful people behind the magnificent and brilliant films so many have seen us enjoy.For the fans that would prefer the first two films, I think the trilogy will stand the test of time. In the spirit that we have for this book, we must be as open as possible and we must love and respect the characters to the utmost degree as to be able to follow through on those who will be the greatest and most powerful, as we have seen over years.To the rest that is who we are that will be blessed to be amongst the best of all our age.I am thankful to everyone that has seen this film and I ask the people of the world, from a whole realm of movies, to put it to the test and to test it and improve it, for not too many will give this film much. It is one book that is going to stand the test of time. This trilogy could not have been made better, and if the movie does not stand it. I must be the first among you, to get myself to where I am, you need to do something. I am sorry to disappoint the entire fans of Tolkien's writings. I am glad Jackson has given these films that special treatment of me, which deserved its due. I am thankful that the movie fans were willing to accept their own destiny by following in Jackson's footsteps and accepting this film, and I hope that others will do the same.<|endoftext|>\n",
      "<|startoftext|>It is a fitting goodbye to a true legend. This is not a film that is perfect.  It should be no different.  There's great scenes from both the original and the extended version, and great cinematography, and great special effects, but this film, like the other two, is simply too great.  This film is too grand to be an extended version of, and it was made without a special effects masterpiece.  It is a shame that it didn't get that high on IMDB.  I can't recommend The Hobbit just because there isn't that much else to do.  It was an incredible movie, and it's definitely a film that is worthy of the Oscars.  But, if you can't find that movie, don't complain, because I wouldn't recommend it for the same reason.  This film is truly one of the greatest trilogy of all time.<|endoftext|>\n",
      "<|startoftext|>I think there is no question that the Return of the King was a great movie. It's still a fine first third to go, and it has great effects, which are a given for movies which are almost three years old, but it is a very good movie, and one of the best movies ever made. The special effects are top notch as are the performances. The characters are not too bad either - all the action was very impressive. The acting and direction is superb as they do not come to perfection from a script. What can I say about this 3rd installment? You can't really complain about these movies, because it just so happens that this movie is my favorite of all time. I like to think that in the time since it first started to go out (just before the movie was finally cut on November 4th), the original story is going strong. I have never met so many fans who liked this movie so highly. It will be a long time before you see this movie again. I mean, I haven't seen the extended DVD, but I've definitely seen more of it.<|endoftext|>\n",
      "<|startoftext|>The third installment of ROTK makes me very happy when I have seen it for the first time. I have also seen it when it was first released, and I can only say thanks to all the people involved and friends who have given these movies far and wide a 10\n",

      " CGI. We must never forget the original novels, and the stories of the characters, including Gandalf and Rohan.The Return of the King was the most thrilling of the Tolkien trilogy, but it failed to deliver the movie, mainly due to the length of the first two films. The climax of the movie was breathtaking, full of wonder and action. A great movie, the movie deserved at least 7 Oscars and it deserved at least 3 Academy Awards. In this story, Sauron and his army of orcs return and destroy the lands of men and women. Sauron's army makes the world over for the first time. They destroy all the cities of the world with their armies of loots. The only thing that is weak is the orcs. In the series the king of Rohan and his army make it to the brink of the ring of death. This is his last battle against the orcs. There was more action than in any other film and there were scenes of people fighting. In a perfect world with an atmosphere of magic and peace, there would not have been any problems. As we have seen in our movies, there are no easy battles in this film.<|endoftext|>\n",
      "<|startoftext|>It's amazing, but maybe not very far out... In the previous two movies, the battle sequences were better. I was sad, but still glad for the Return of the King. One thing that was great were the cinematics... They're beautiful. And they aren't in a bad way. I liked it. Not quite as much as it's predecessors. My only complaint is that you need to be 15 or 16 or 17 or 18 to watch the other two movies (as that will cost $15 each of LOTR and the DVD). But the three others do have nice visual qualities that are better than the first two. I really love what I'm seeing. What I find a little more impressive is how well they all move you to the edge of emotions when it's all over, and how they never stray from a simple, beautiful movie. In this series, things get really emotional in all three. I recommend watching one of the others, but just remember to sit down.<|endoftext|>\n",
      "<|startoftext|>Having been introduced at midnight to this one, I must say it was a brilliant movie.  A movie to be enjoyed over and over again.  I cannot say enough good things about this movie.  I give this trilogy an 11, not a 9.  It isn't even close to a 4.   There are several excellent bits, and I'll wait till the extended edition comes out, and then go back and watch more of these films.<|endoftext|>\n",
      "<|startoftext|>What a beautiful, beautiful film. The Return of the King continues the story of Gandalf, Gollum, Rohan and the army of the dead.  It has no shortage of action sequences and a great deal of dialogue.  I found it quite good as was the case with Star Wars and Indiana Jones, but it would still be a great film if it was cut back to 11.I am also a big fan of the books, and find the Return of the King excellent, although a little bit dull at times when my expectations are high.  The scenes with Gollum and his companions were somewhat dull and not particularly interesting at all, but the film is still amazing.  The fight scenes are very good, and The Two Towers is a worthy final film if it really isn't a masterpiece.  But if it isn't a masterpiece, I don't think this movie has it.  The film is not perfect, but more than is very possible with this genre.  There is a lot to go through and we do miss a lot of the moments from the first two in the book, but there are those moments that make us feel the characters again.  I really liked all the parts that we didn't expect to, and I really want to see more scenes from this movie.  And this will be my final film.<|endoftext|>\n",
      "<|startoftext|>The third of three!<|startoftext|>I've been a fan of LOTR since I first heard about it in 2003 to this point. I've watched LOTR hundreds of times and has a fondness for the three novels. LOTR 3 is still my go to watch, even when I've not read it. The movie is just incredible, and a masterpiece. The ending of the movie is a great way to end this trilogy as a movie. The action sequences are awesome too. I know it's not the perfect ending, but I don't mind watching the three hours of this movie. I hope that people will give this a better rating than 9 because it was a good movie overall. The acting in this movie is excellent, and the plot is not as good as it could be. Most of the cast in\n",

      " that has already ended and left us with the impression that we see the world through Frodo's eyes or that he's actually there in the flesh. In the movie it is the viewer that is truly affected by each person. While the battles are extremely technical and exciting, the emotion of the final act is so dark and tragic that the viewers are left aghast. It would seem that the end product was not as bad, but ultimately it was much weaker. Perhaps we could have waited until the end of Return of the King to feel the horror. There were things to consider. But, just as in the previous two films, that is the problem. Return of the King was bad and not worth the movie. It lacked the emotion and drama it had in the earlier two films in that it was not quite a \"good\" film, to take just one example, and that said, the emotional side of Return of the King is better.I still can't wrap my head around all the flaws in the movie and, more recently, that the ending was too emotional. But the ending alone couldn't do. The film is a journey, you can never know what your next steps are, the ending left me breathless. It has everything: the suspense, the emotional resonance, the emotional impact. The film is a must-see for anyone wanting to be the ultimate film buff. The music and vocal effects combine perfectly with the tension. And yes, I can't help but feel that if this film had ended several hours earlier, I would have felt a little choked up. However, I've never felt an emotional attachment to this trilogy. When Frodo and Sam had their final battle for Gondor, the book ended. It was almost as if the film had concluded without them. The final act took a few twists, particularly the scene at Isengard. I don't know why, but it's sad to see the end of the Fellowship. A fine end to the trilogy.<|endoftext|>\n",

As a major movie fan and avid movie watcher, I have not only watched all of Jackson's three trilogy, but have also watched all three installments in the LOTR trilogy. LOTR: The Return of the King is the first and second film in the trilogy that I have ever personally owned, loved, and enjoyed. The Fellowship of the Ring was quite possibly my favorite ending to the movie; the Two Towers was more of a disappointment.The main movie of the trilogy is The Return of the King. This movie takes the trilogy to an unprecedented new level. When I watch this movie at home, I can almost hear, rather than be able to hear, the tears in my eyes. This is the most extraordinary ending to a monumental epic. I never expected it to be this powerful and emotion-grabbing. I could taste the emotions in my eyes for hours afterward. The Return of the King is a beautiful end to an incredible trilogy, one I have cried over all my life, but I am grateful that Jackson has given us so much hope.I have to say that it is a great honor and honor to work with Peter Jackson and his team to create the trilogy that will live on for many years to come.  Not only was it a great honor to be involved, but I am grateful for the privilege and dedication. I hope that the Academy, as a whole, will uphold the spirit of the original story and encourage Jackson to return his attention to the story even more.  For more about this movie, please see the \"Ride of the Rohirrim\" trilogy, \"Return of the King\" and \"Return of the King: The Return of the King\". Thank you Peter for a film for all of its merits.  This trilogy is by far my favorite of the LOTR trilogy, and the final film will probably be the best of the series.<|endoftext|>\n",
      "<|startoftext|>The Lord of the Rings is the most powerful book in the history of literature. Tolkien had created an elaborate and beautiful world, and told his story in a way that was not difficult to understand.Peter Jackson, the legendary director of the movie trilogy, was one of the most talented and ambitious people on film. He really pulled it off and adapted the best story ever told and had many talents for directing. For Peter Jackson, the journey to the end of the world was not the simple task of a single individual.<|endoftext|>\n",
      "<|startoftext|>A great movie that the cast of the series has. Peter Jackson is so skillful and so well done in the first part of the series. This film has plenty to offer you. You never know how\n",

      " go in the 3rd movie. I guess the movie is so great from a story perspective that we should love it. When we saw the first 2, I was scared of it, though... The first 2 are wonderful. The special effects and special effects were amazing. Then we saw the final movie and started to watch. I'm so glad that I had to see the best of all 3 in the special effects. They were pretty good, although the battle sequences were way too long. (I guess I could say this, but even so these are the best of them all!) That concludes my review of The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, but in the end, I didn't believe it as much. It had all those little differences from the 2 movies that were too distracting. Now that I'm able to see 3 movies before my 50th birthday, it'll take more than just watching the 2 movies! I will read these reviews again, but for now, I really have to give my 10-3-5 (especially the extended edition. It's the most powerful and exciting one. If you don't believe that, go get it, but also watch the 3 other movies I mentioned.)<|endoftext|>\n",
      "<|startoftext|>Well, I hope we can all take a moment and say how much we miss Peter Jackson. Maybe we'll never see the movies again, but maybe this little Hobbit movie in our lifetimes will be a touchstone lesson in movie making, and maybe someday, all around...we'll be able to see movies like this on screen. I just hope that he and his crew come out with the next movie, and release the first two (and all the extended edition) into the same wide release. Thank you to all who have contributed and contributed to this movie, and especially to all other LOTR movies. The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King will be a landmark in movie making history.<|endoftext|>\n",
      "<|startoftext|>The Lord of the rings is a triology. The Lord of the rings was not a movie. He had not been told that at the movie, he would be forced to make a decision, so why did he never tell the rest of Ring-wise? The real ring was that of Eowyn. Eowyn was the daughter of a lord of evil - Eowyn the Witch-King. In the extended edition, they finally tell Eowyn that she was conceived not by man but by his will. The actual ending is not told, only later does it. It's not explained, the book is not written by Tolkien, and nobody was paid for anything. The reason why they cannot get an explanation is that it gives rise to all this doubt, because no one knew Eowyn would ever have an option of loving a man. The only explanation given is that they could make a movie about that very subject.The three ring was also a myth. The myth was that they were made by a demon from another dimension. The story has been interpreted into many different tales, but only some of them involve Ring-man, and these stories have never been told in modern cinema. The movie based the myth on one story, and the myth was re-interpreted by the director, giving the producers of The Lord of Towers credit for taking the story into their own hands. The director, in the second movie, was hired to make two more movies, with the same idea. He re-interpreted the myth into three movies. He re-shined the same lenses as in The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, making The Hobbit. This film has the same thing, but has a different story, a different ending. This film is more interesting, and is more profitable, than The Lord of Rings: The Return of the King; if a director is hired to make this film, they must hire a different director. Many famous directors, such as John Ford, Bill Withers, Howard Shore, Christopher Lee, John Rhys-Davies and John Noble have all been hired to re-interpret the stories from The Lord of the Rings. It is a wonder that all the directors hired for these movies, including Mr. Jackson, have given it the same names as the Lord of the Rings films they made. They make The Lord, and the Lord of Rings in their name. The directors are just greedy, because they see their business interests. They want to create a more profitable movie making business, which will increase their profits. They are merely interested in making a profit, and want some share of the profits. If the people wanted it their way of life in order to become better, they would have the money themselves. All movies are made by special effects, and computer graphics. They need money to make them, and special effects to make them. The special effects are cheap, cheap and all-encompassing. The special effects are based on real creatures\n",

      " movie's ending, we're left with an empty feeling about what's been given. Maybe this final scene gave the viewer something to hold on to and say goodbye. Maybe it just made the ending seem like an out-of-body experience. But for me, it was more than just an ending; it gave a sense of closure. The end feels a lot more like a triumph for filmmaking than the beginning, but I'm certainly a lot more exited for the others.I guess what I take away from the movie is the same three things which I don't take away from The Lord of the Rings Trilogy:One) The action sequences are great, but also have a bad reputation. They do have a few moments of pure spectacle, but for my money, they are way too subdued. Two) The pacing is slow, in a way. It is a pity that it has to be 3 hours, because The Return of the King is one of those slow films which doesn't seem to get boring at all. One of the best moments of the entire trilogy, involving Pippin and Merry, is an almost-deserting 10,000 degree FOV, and the battles are simply too out of the ordinary to mention, aside from the occasional skirmish.As to the writing, there are very few \"book\" elements, much less any battle scenes whatsoever. Instead, the greatest writer work is carried out through the use of novel techniques. We see a lot more than in the previous films in this trilogy, and so we're actually treated to some of the greatest scenes of the movie. We see fantastic sets, models, and CGI, yet rarely see any of it ourselves. And we also see characters who don't look exactly like you, and in many cases we don't even know who they're supposed to be. In the battles, for instance, we see Arwen at the battle of sheodles and arrows, and we watch our heroes defeat an army of trolls, because it seems the only possible outcome from the books. We see a great deal more of Sam as a lead in the battle and his dealings with Frodo, than we do in this film.The ending is, in my opinion, the best of the entire trilogy. It is almost impossible to film this in a 3 hour long film, and Jackson decided to do just that, by wrapping up the trilogy in the very same way that The Godfather left out - leaving us with one movie after the other. All that time we're left with the most emotionally charged of the whole series of events, the one conclusion to the series, which is what I consider to be one of the greatest achievements in film history; and in my opinion, Jackson does just that.The ending, in short, is the best we've ever seen in a movie, and it is entirely appropriate. There are many good points that need to be said, and this has been one of them.All in all, this trilogy is a masterpiece. There were several tears, moments of pure joy, sorrow, happiness, ecstasy, and awe that were brought to the screen by the films, and the books. We should be so blessed with such beauty. There is very little to compliment this trilogy. You should be able to sit down and watch The Hobbit Trilogy on its own, to enjoy the stories and characters that came before it.<|endoftext|>\n",
      "<|startoftext|>I loved the first Lord of the Rings film. But did it really stand the test of time???  The first Lord of the Rings film was just so good.  It had such a good story which we knew was good!!!  Then a year later, I watched the first two and loved them very much.  I was on the edge of my seat watching this film and seeing my mouth water and looking at my eyes start to dry up.  I didn't get into watching the Lord of the Rings movies until I saw this movie.  I also read the books, so I wasn't familiar with them.  When I saw this film, I didn't know when to jump on board the Titanic or do aerial shots of it.  I watched the first two without any knowledge whatsoever. I felt extremely moved by the film of Middle Earth that I felt a special kinship with it.  I felt very sad.   A lot of people who were not involved in The Lord of the Rings trilogy do not realize that The Lord of the Rings trilogy is the culmination of the first two films. The Lord of the Rings trilogy was based on the book by J.R.R. Tolkein. Tolkien was a professor at Oxford University until he started making his best work in the late 1970's.  A lot of the work he did is over-the-top: he takes the reader on a great adventure and then presents it to us.  He tries to tell you just what you want to see, but we already know so much more about what you want to see.  There are other films which\n",

      " had been, not for the last time. I love Gollum, I hope he grows up to be a good role model for millions more to follow. There are far better movies out there, I'm just waiting they can't all be released together...<|endoftext|>\n",
      "<|startoftext|>With the finale of this great finale movie, there's no denying the greatness of this film. It is a special and immensely powerful film with epic battles, breathtaking panoramic shots, wonderful acting, music, everything. It's a film you want to watch again and again. The first two are incredible, The Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers should have be seen to-die-for-one-more-year.This final part of the trilogy completes my list of favorite movies of all time.<|endoftext|>\n",
      "<|startoftext|>First of all, this movie is unbelievable. I had high hopes and expectations for this movie, I wasn't disappointed, but I was disappointed not only by the movie itself and for that matter the whole trilogy, but also in the story. This movie is fantastic, the cast is wonderful, the action is well put together, and the emotion is incredible. I love it, well go and see it!<|endoftext|>\n",
      "<|startoftext|>I really wanted to like it, but it was awful, awful. This movie was better than The Godfather....the Matrix....I liked The Godfather best....the Godfather better than the Lord of the Rings but this movie ruined it for me.<|endoftext|>\n",
      "<|startoftext|>What a long way to go! The movie is not as exciting or impressive as a good fantasy movie. It has a flat plot (with no plot trees) and the ending is very long. The plot of LOTR involves a ring that was destroyed by the power of Anamnesiacs. An unfortunate hobbit discovers the ring, and he embarks on a long journey to destroy it. The third part of the LOTR Trilogy features a fight scene between the forces of good and evil, but a great deal of material is left for the hobbits to play in this fight, especially the hobbits' encounter with Gandalph the Watcher in the tower of Cirith Ungol. Some examples of short, boring, shallow dialogue with no dialog are the battle at the Black Gate before Helm's Deep...It was so boring that I actually walked out of the movie. But when it comes out on DVD, it is as boring as a regular TV episode, and I guess it was more that I wanted to watch this. It was so long and boring.<|endoftext|>\n",
      "<|startoftext|>Like the other Two Towers movies, The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King falls into this category of films that are, on the one hand, excellent (though often overrated), but on the other hand they are also good films, and LOTR:RTOTK belongs to that category.\n",
      "For those of you who have not yet seen the movie, read the book and read the movie as prepared by Tolkien. Those who haven't, go now and see it. If you haven't haven't read The Hobbit, you need to get rid of it immediately. Some people, who really hate the movie, will say its too sentimental, it doesn't follow the book, and it is overused.I personally, though, find the trilogy to be the best of them all, and I would have given it a higher rating if it wasn't for the fact that it has sentimental value.<|endoftext|>\n",
      "<|startoftext|>The first two films in the legendary Lord of the Rings trilogy were absolutely phenomenal. The third installment is, however, very much my favourite of the 3. The main reason for this is the ending. It just seemed so far off that it actually made the film seem to be a parody, and not even that. The whole ending seemed just too drawn-out. I even thought that the whole film seemed to be a parody of everything else. It looked amazing. It was like a parody of everything that had before and everything that had since come before.<|endoftext|>\n",
      "<|startoftext|>What can I say that hasn't been said? Return of the Jedi was fantastic!!! I loved the first two movies in this series, and this one was absolutely the best, but I enjoyed it a whole lot more then the other 2! The battle of Pelennor Fields is an incredible moment, the battle of the Pelennor Fields is a great emotional moment, and the Two Towers was fantastic and then the end was at the door...and then it goes quiet ... I'm sorry that's all over yet...I'm sure I'll just have to look around the house and see what I'm missing now...I just can't\n",

      "/openglider.com/ The best thing is that this works brilliantly for me. It is so easy to get bored with this film after reading the books that it helps to draw the person who is interested in the hobby to the world of Middle Earth. This is a brilliant set of films that has it all. I can scarcely wait to see it again...<|endoftext|>\n",
      "<|startoftext|>I went to the 11:20 P.M. showing of ROTK to watch the \"King\" as I had been planning on seeing it for about 2 months and still couldn't make it out of the theater. The crowd in the theater was more than happy to oblige, as Gollum, the madman turned \"Bad Momma\" was the biggest and best action movie ever to be filmed. After the closing credits, it was a little while later before the movie was over, so I waited for the intermission alarm clock so I could see when the movie would end. On a recent Thursday afternoon last November, my girlfriend, then 20, went to see ROTK as I was planning on going to see it. She reminded me of another fan of mine who just saved her from the movie, and that was a terrific experience I will never forget.I can't remember when my imagination was capable of capturing the sheer amazing spectacle involved in a movie, but with the advent of modern technology, I could, and would. The acting was fabulous, with lots of them. I went to the bathroom less than 30 minutes before the film came to a close, and at the end of the movie I nearly fell asleep; while at the theater, I didn't go to the bathroom, only to retrieve my bag through the opening pantinal door. I must have seen an extra 50-600 pages, or so, that was. When I returned home after watching the trilogy again, I took a yearning out of the theater. The Lord of the rings saga may have ended about halfway through the first film, but its end wasn't entirely satisfying. The movie experience that I had before was mostly over at this point, leaving me feeling wholly empty, with no idea of what came next and, therefore, no confidence in the films at all. Peter Jackson may be the greatest and the greatest director of our time but he has not really succeeded in doing the things \"Jackson\" has done. His films may be the best of the series but they are not the greatest. Peter Jackson is not a great director, and his failings in the making of \"Return of the king\" are more conspicuous in the subsequent work.I have no doubt that \"The\" trilogy of Tolkien's \"The Lord of the Rings\" will someday be treated in the finest traditions of film, no matter how superior it may seem today. The Lord of the rings saga, and not the Tolkien trilogy of the FOTR, was which trilogy of books was better?<|endoftext|>\n",
      "<|startoftext|>For me The Lord of the Rings is one of the best written fantasy books of all time and in many cases all time.  For me Tolkien is a brilliant director who made his fantasy world a reality, while still remaining true to the book and its characters.I think the movie \"The Lord of the Rings\" was a great conclusion to the series and for every bit of dialogue done in the movie (I could write two sentences about it), there was a whole whole brouhaha with Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) who all lost their way of control of the ring and ended up in a madness of complete madness.  And Elijah Wood played a part in giving the movie to Frodo who was beginning to get into it with his brother Elijah, and Sam was showing a lot of signs of having the ring and Frodo was beginning to get mad at one of Frodo's buddies who was showing signs of hobitancy.So this was a great end to the trilogy and could not have happened when all was said and done.  I agree with the other movie people that the movie should have ended about a hundred years ago on the boat left from the end of the \"hobbit\" and that we'll never know of the history of the hobbit.I think this final film of the series is a great work of cinema history. It shows that even when the books were considered as a whole with their fantasy and Tolkien's dialog, we as the viewers had no ability to see the whole series as one whole and in fact even when we saw a handful of parts (such as the one at the dockyard) on the silver screen, we were not able to really grasp the whole series in its entirety. This is especially true for me (not having read any of the books, but sure having seen all of Tolkien's works).I don't have a problem with Jackson's interpretation of Tolkien's tale, but for me this was too perfect for me at times\n",

      " I can't find much to comment on for those who have read the books and don't have time to appreciate each character or to relay their feelings and experiences of the trilogy to friends and relatives (who, by the way, rarely have time to rate the films!).My final comment relates to the romance that is treated with the first two films. Whereas in the books it was between Aragorn and his love interest, Eomer, in the movies it was between Frodo and Sam, I don't believe Tolkien intended to evoke such a dynamic fusion of feelings in this movie. Whereas Aragorn and Frodo's final journey into Mordor and the final beginning of Smeagol's adventure brought tears to my eyes, after two years of film-making the last 30 minutes of this epic are as luscious, wonderful, and magnificent as ever (the bittersweet feeling of the farewells that the lovers has after so many years is almost too much to bear).<|endoftext|>\n",

      "After the best film of the trilogy was Return of the King (RTL:RLR) it was time to make ROTK. The build-up to ROTK left me breathless; after almost three years in the cinema, I know the following: This movie is the greatest movie of all time. The battle sequences cannot be matched; the emotional weight of all of the victims is so pure, that even if the DVD runs you for life, it will always touch you. The action scenes are simply spectacular, and the acting is superb.I was so looking forward to this movie, and having nightmares about it ending, that I never looked at my watch during the movie. I was always hoping that Saruman (no Saruman) would appear again, but he is absolutely fantastic. He is the most convincing and brilliant character in the trilogy, and if there wasn't on the big screen, he would have been far more pleasing to my eyes.Peter Jackson's genius as a director caught the attention of everyone, and they all got their money's worth. The whole LOTR trilogy caught people's interest, caught the imagination of both fans and movie-goers. The entire LOTR enterprise, from ROTK to ROTK is a stunning achievement, and the best two movies ever. It's all just too much for words.<|endoftext|>\n",
      "<|startoftext|>The special effects have been surpassed, and it´s all over. What a journey. The third part of the trilogy, The Two Towers, brings us to, and we can not imagine living again without it. For the first time ever, visual sets and props and costumes have truly replaced real life, on all levels.I could not be happier about the result of this epic, it´s already been dubbed the greatest trilogy ever made.\n",
      "The final part, will no doubt be a landmark in the history of film, followed by a fitting third instalment in the giant B movie wars. Both will be immortal in books, but in the most essential way. The Return of the King completes one of the most remarkable series of epics ever created.\n",
      "The journey, will be a part of our collective minds forever.<|endoftext|>\n",
      "<|startoftext|>It was so long... I was tired, but then I haven't read the books! I love fantasy, and this movie was just about as much of my favorite as I was, and my least favorite. I can hardly wait for the extended DVD, so I can see it all in full. The end, was the best movie I've ever seen, and will be forever remembered as the most beautiful movie of all time. And by movie you also get to see the story and the characters of the book. I have read most of the books in high school, and every now and then I dream of going to movies, but I knew right at the end that at last, I had just discovered something I always wanted, and was going to watch a movie about it: Return of the King. I must have cried because, although I had read the book, my emotions just couldn't carry me through the movie. However, I could not have asked for a better end to a series of movies. These, and these last, have been the most fulfilling out of the three movies. I was happy that Jackson was able to get these books from Viking and to my satisfaction Tolkien felt he could have done with them a little more detail and detail, in addition to the special effects and special FX. However, all this was before he even considered using any special FX he possibly could to bring the story into our own. It was such a long wait and finally I got to see it the first time, and I was not disappointed. I really cannot say enough about Peter Jackson and his team, and especially this past week i cannot tell you how much i loved this movie\n",

      " and good movie. And not a single bad scene or part of a movie could have possibly been found in this trilogy.In short, it's a brilliant movie and a brilliant business plan. It's one of the best fantasy/copyright/fantasy movies to ever be made on film. And it was made so cheap that it made many people feel uncomfortable sitting in a Cinema to see it for the first time.I don't give a damn about Tolkien's work as much as Peter Jackson's and I think, with the current standards and technology, Peter Jackson should at least give all his props to his excellent actor performances in these films. If we want to get a sense of the scale and diversity of the film industry, I think that Ian MacKellen, Viggo Mortensen and Christopher Lee would be proud of the movies as are any Hobbit fans. This trilogy will live and breathe for a very long time and probably will remain etched in history as one of the most successful ventures in filmmaking.And now we are finished. As usual with great films this is Return of the King, but this time on a whole. 10/10<|endoftext|>\n",
      "<|startoftext|>This movie was pretty much the first movie I watched (about every other week for that matter) and it was actually a pretty good movie.  I don't know how a movie based around 100+ actors was able to do its job better than actors, in this case, directing, acting and lighting.  However, I'm pretty sure that there is no way the movie could have done it without also directing.And it did take away a few of the advantages that directing had over cgi (i.e. no editing) and it also created those 3 scenes that were the focus of this movie:First, cgi was very low and it was clear at most appearances and only a handful would ever make it happen.  A few notable exceptions include Peter Jackson and Viggo Moretensen.  The last movie in the trilogy, \"The Lords of the World\", had no cgi at all.  But, with the pace of the battle, it was a no-brainer.  Every shot was judged from start to point. I'd give this movie a 10 or a 7.  In this particular movie, I'd give it a 10.<|endoftext|>\n",
      "<|startoftext|>What can you say about this visually stunning film. Sure, it's a little slow here and there but it packs an extraordinary feel punch. I loved every moment of it. The special effects were spectacular and the battles were simply mind boggling. Nothing could top this opening opening opening music video.I recommend this film to anyone who enjoys good movie-making. I give it 9/10.You don't know where you're going to go next week!<|endoftext|>\n",
      "<|startoftext|>After seeing the Fellowship of the Ring, I came of age with the Two Towers, and I arrived with the Return of the King.  The new Peter Jackson to bring you an outstanding finished film from the epic tale of Middle Earth! Excellent acting, thrilling scenes, beautiful films and a wonderful visual style. Peter Jackson deserves every accolade that he is given and they all belong to him! As I look back on this amazing three hour special, I can't help but feel that there should be a celebration for the finest film ever made! All of my expectations were met in this final installment. I think of the films as one big film in a long history of amazing film-making. This film follows that same pattern. Each film is an epic adventure. It has epic sights, small battles and brings together the spirit of Tolkien's work. However, I am saddened that the film is ending. It is sad that this generation's greatest achievement is ending with one brilliant film! I hope this generation will see the films and not the other way around. They were all perfect. Peter Jackson and his crew created a classic tale. I consider this film a landmark that has stood the test of time. It is an example of good vs. evil and the best of films. It is the movie that a lot of us will see and not the other way around! Let's take this journey with all of us! I am glad to be of help to Mr. Peter Jackson. His passion and efforts went a step beyond what any other director could have ever envisioned.<|endoftext|>\n",
      "<|startoftext|>Peter Jackson being only the second director to win the Best Picture Oscar, and in 2001 and 2002 (along with Ben Hur) the first and only directors to win the Best Director Oscar (and they both were) and this time it is Best Picture(s). It may seem odd that a director can co-star in Best Picture recognition with the worst?  I thought it was quite obvious one of them(the other one) were Two Towers directors. I really did!\n",

      "It is already the largest of the three films in the series. You have probably seen it in the cinema, maybe not in your local pub. It is a very uncomfortable movie for most people but it is totally worth it. The only thing you have to look forward to now is the final chapter which contains the very last part of the story. It will blow you away...<|endoftext|>\n",
      "<|startoftext|>This movie blew me away. I remember sitting in the theatre during this movie, and I was totally blown away by the end! I was in awe throughout. The movie had everything you could ever ask for in a movie. The actors were amazing, the scenery amazing, the story was great. I was in awe of the characters as well. We all have different personal stories of what happened to Frodo and his adventures throughout the 3 years of Middle Earth. The movie left me completely satisfied. I did not want the story to end. Never in my life did I expect to hate it. I LOVED it. I LOVED The RETURN OF THE KING. I have now watched it several times and it has been amazing. I will not get into details when to watch it, but I am now going to give it a try and give it a 10. It is a good movie and a great ending to a good trilogy. The reason this movie is called THE RETURN OF THE KING is because it has everything you could ever ask for in a movie. Action, romance, drama, comedy, action, it is just simply amazing. It would be a 7.5 out of 10 for me. I am already planning my next vacation days so don't get mad if this movie doesn't live up to everything I expected it to. I am glad that I didn't have to wait a year longer for the extended version. If this movie doesn't live up to everything I expected it to, then I will never get to experience good cinema again. This is the best movie I have ever seen. 9 out of 10 (out of 10) for the RETURN OF THE KING. For better, more perfectly cinema.<|endoftext|>\n",
      "<|startoftext|>Peter Jackson has accomplished what many dream of: long and boring (if you want a good long movie, watch The Fellowship Of The Ring, The Two Towers, or the Godfather Part III, you will not like it, unless you are a hardcore Ring-Tricker). I could go on and on about the great performances (especially Billy Boyd's) by the actors, but I think the same can be said of any great piece of film-making. This film deserves the title of \"Best Film Of All Time,\" because it transcends all genre-less films and instead shows the human condition in a more positive light. It shows that people like people, not monsters, and because it is an allegory of friendship, love, and justice.<|endoftext|>\n",
      "<|startoftext|>I have never been a fan of fantasy/horror/comedy/gang-of-wizards. I think this is a waste. I love all three of the LOTR movies. JRR Tolkien has a special love for this genre. I also think that in a story that ties all the books together, Peter Jackson did a great job of telling the story that most people have grown tired of, and it shows. The only problem with this movie is the last 20 minutes or so that it ends. And the ending 20 minutes are very boring. I just loved it.<|endoftext|>\n",
      "<|startoftext|>This movie was simply awesome.  I loved every minute of it and the only thing that bothered me more than the ending was the movie itself.  I also think that it was the best ending I've ever seen in my life.  If this film doesn't win every Oscar it is nominated for, it is simply a travesty.  I really wish that the Oscars would be given to a movie that didn't waste time winning awards.  Hopefully that movie will win more than something that had already been awarded. I just hope that something is done to award all the outstanding awards that came out of this movie.  I have never seen a better ending to this trilogy of the greatest trilogy ever created.  I also hope that something is done to award all the outstanding entries in the Lord of the Rings contest.  I really wish that someone would give the all three movies an attention for the next 10 years.<|endoftext|>\n",
      "<|startoftext|>Just got home from seeing \"The Return of the King\" at the midnight screening. The movie was great, I had expected a bit more but still felt that there was too much to cover. The action was fantastic, everything from the acting to the special effects. I would recommend this movie to anyone, especially those who haven't read the books.I'm sorry to say\n"
