"This is simply the best movie I have ever seen. There is no other way to put it. It's incredible beyond all expectations, and after reading the books and watching the movies you bond with the characters and when one passes away or leaves middle earth you feel as if you've lost a friend. At the point on Mount Doom where Samwise says ""I can't carry it for you, but I can carry you!"" is the best and most emotional part (excepting maybe the Grey Havens) and I nearly cried. The story is perfect, the actors are magnificent, and the music is the best soundtrack I've ever heard. I sobbed at the Havens (and I'm a teenage boy!) and I believe that really says how great this movie is. Ten out of ten stars is a complete understatement. This is the only movie that exists that deserves an Eleven star award."
"If the first film bored you to tears and the second one bored you to death, the third film will not affect you because you are now numb and totally disinterested. We have even more of those pointless scenes with Sam and Frodo, more battles and more CGI. And how many endings can a film have?There's a huge battle and then they tell you there is another one. And it's still not over, because there are a million loose ends. And then they go back home. And then Bilbo leaves home. And then Sam has children. Is that the end or is there more? I can't even remember. I fell asleep during one of the particularly tedious scenes with Sam and Frodo. This is not a film. It's a pointless sequence of scenes and an exercise in CGI that resembles a video game - one you can only watch, but not play. And I still don't care about a single bloody character in this film!"
"I loved the first Lord of the Rings, and The Two Towers was okay (the Director's Cut was better), but this film just dragged and dragged.The seven scenes around the funeral pyre were about six too many for me. (That wasn't a spoiler. You don't know who or why or where.) Actually, it shouldn't be possible to write spoilers of this film. Who doesn't know the story? Actually, even if you don't, the film is stupidly predictable. I left midway through the film to go to the bathroom (and almost didn't come back) and despite spending about 20 minutes procrastinating returning to the theatre, apparently all I missed was PEOPLE GETTING FROM POINT A TO POINT B!!! A truly disappointing finale to the series."
"The novel by John Ronald Reuel Tolkien was said to be impossible to adapt for the cinema, Peter Jackson has done it ! I have read the novel and I think we can say that he has done it perfectly ! It's a perfect adaptation ! 3 hours and 12 minutes of intense happiness !I saw this extraordinary movie three times and it's always the same wonderful feelings ! I always shiver when Frodo is followed by Arachne and when he must destroy the Ring and he doesn't want to any more... even if I know what will happen !This movie is also served by a great cast: the excellent Ian McKellen, the funny John Rhys-Davies, the moving Elijah Wood, Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan, the very convincing Viggo Mortensen, the unbelievable Andy Serkis, the beautiful Liv Tyler and all the others, Orlando Bloom, Sean Bean, David Wenham, Bernard Hill, Karl Urban, Miranda Otto and so on.But an actor has impressed me more than the others: Sean Astin is really fantastic in the role of Samwise Gamegie !Finally, the music is exceptional ! So, we can't ask something more ! Thank you Mister Jackson !"
"The Return of the King stands as one of the best LOTR, Tolkien-based and fantasy movies of all time. First of all, it's the only LOTR movie that doesn't feel too long even in its extended edition. It keeps you excited literally for all the 4 hours of lenght of the film. I think having an extended edition of return of the king is partly compulsory, because it has added some scenes that are important for the continuity of the whole story (E.g.: Saruman's fate). Secondly, I felt that CG was very much improved since the previous film. Here, CG creatures felt much more real than in ""The Two Towers"".Overall, this movie certainly deserves being one of the films with most Oscars ever, it just deserved all of them!"
"Wonderful on every level. Love the characters and special effects. One of the biggest, most massive battle scenes ever put on the silver screen. A great end to a monumental epic.A thrilling final chapter to the Lord of the Rings trilogy concerning the epic conclusion to Peter Jackson's enthralling look at temptation, greed, power, and good vs. evil. This is a glorious final chapter. From Gollum's dance of glee at the foot of Mount Doom, to the final battle sequence against the orcs, Peter Jackson stuffs this film with memorable scenes and unforgettable landscapes that fit his epic scope. Although not the best in the trilogy (that belongs to 'Two Towers'), definitely a fitting conclusion to a decorated series."
"Lord of the ring movie is one of the best movies! it's great. wonderful to watch! great fighting scenes. great action. acting is good. fun.. great story. awesome movie must watch movie one of the best series ever made!the great thing in the movie is that we don't get bored while watching it! its a really long movie .. still i love to watch it! Because as said lots of fun and really lots of adventure in the movie to see! Great magic and great fighting scene make movie great! The elf who is two minded is great to watch! its a really good must watch the movie! movie makes us laugh , fill adventure , great action and in the last great performance by all actor! great animation too. it a really good movie to watch! different creature is designed well."
"A timeless classic that should be part of every child's introduction into the world. Necessary to the education and growth of any individual. A well written trilogy filled with sarcasm, adventure, and excitement, turned into perfectly adapted movies. Some characters importance might have been exaggerated but that can be easily looked over because of how well it adds to the story-line of the movies. These movies are easily some of the most quotable movies ever made, making several memes that lasted for years, and teaching the next generation about the importance of reading Tolken's work. If you haven't read the books I definitely recommend you do, they definitely add to the overall experience, and quite possibly get you even more hooked."
"What I liked1. The acting was top notch2. The effects hold up amazing today3. The length really was not that bad despite 200 minutes4. The book still matters in this movie which is very nice to know5. The action is amazing tooWhat I didn't like1. The ending was a little bit dragged outOverall despite the one annoying flaw of the ending feeling like twenty years, this movie was a great send off to a great trilogy that I am very proud to say I am a fan of and while the Hobbit movies are not the best, this holds up and will always hold up"
well the summary explains all its one of the only movies if not the only movie that kept me 100% exited from the first to the last minute well they saved the best for last best story book and best acting directing... I recommend it to every person its a CLASSIC that will always be remembered as one of the best and for me its the best movie observed by my eyes!!finally I have seen a movie that is so much better than Titanic!!well the summary explains all its one of the only movies if not the only movie that kept me 100% exited from the first to the last minute well they saved the best for last best story book and best acting directing... I recommend it to every person its a CLASSIC that will always be remembered as one of the best and for me its the best movie observed by my eyes!!
"This is, by far, the best movie of the LOTR trilogy. It is very long, but it is worth every minute. I can think of only a precious few (no pun intended) movies, specifically, action movies, that are better than this movie.I love Andy Serkis's Gollum/Smeagol voice. I have a friend who can sound just like Gollum, although he is no match for Andy Serkis.***WARNING!!! MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD!!! DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THIS MOVIE!!*** Frodo Baggins is nearing the end of his journey to destroy the evil Ring, along with Sam and Gollum. We find that, after ""leaving"" Smeagol in TTT, Gollum apparently is back in ROTK. He talks to himself a lot, and has an evil plan of getting rid of Sam. He poisons Frodo's mind, and Frodo sends Sam away. Later, however, Sam returns and injures Shelob, the humongous spider that lived in the cave that Gollum sent Frodo in. Later, it's Gollum, not Frodo, who destroys the Ring. Gollum, of course dies in the process. Sauron is destroyed as well. The explosion of his tower is excellent.The final battles, the acting, the music, and everything else in this movie is 100% perfect.My score: 10/10"
"It faithfully showed all the best things from the books and brought middle earth to our TV and cinema screens which is awesome and legendary, all in all one of the best movies i'we ever watched and i strongly recommend for everyone to see it,the remorse will not be shown i guaranty you that.The movie can surely be watched by non fantasy fans because it's beautifully shot effects and the music were perfectly done and mixed...i just have one thing that bugs me:Peter should show the audience extended edition because it shows what happened to saruman,and that is a big minus to all book lovers.Aside from that everything else was more than satisfying for me and for most people..."
"As a very old fan of Tolkien's Lord of the Rings trilogy and having suffered through a couple of miserable screen adaptations, I can now say that Peter Jackson's three Lord of the Rings movies are my all-time favorite movie. I felt as though I were really there. New Zealand was the perfect choice for locations. All three films were excellent in every aspect of movie-making art.Warning, spoiler: I could understand all of the changes made by the movie makers to the book except for the very last scene, when Sam comes home after seeing Frodo off at the Grey Havens. In the book, Frodo had invited Sam and Rosie to live with him at Bag End and had bequeathed it to him when he left Middle Earth. However, the movie shows Sam returning to #3 Bagshot Row, his old home. There was no theatrical reason to change this. They wouldn't even have needed an extra scene explaining Sam's return to Rosie and baby Elanor at Bag End. After such a magnificent film adaptation of the book, this final detail was jarring and left me less than enthralled. But overall, the movies are truly outstanding and will be classics for as long as movies are being made."

"First movie not so impressive slow build up, second movie good with decent battles, but the third movie is great conclusion to the epic trilogy, best movie out of all six peter Jackson's vision of the Tolkien work.the battles are of an epic scale, CGI was good for a 2000's movie. there are no negative point to this movie and i have watched the trilogy more than 20 times (extended versions)."
"Possible spoilers...ROTK was far exceeded any expectations I had.  Appealing to both the visceral and the cerebral appetites - it is far and above the best movie of all time. The Smeagol/Gollum realization was superb, and the emergence of the supporting characters from TTT was very satisfying.  Last, Peter Jackson has proven that sequels can be (should be) released closer together and maintain audience interest...in fact it heightens it. Remarkable."
"***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** Does anyone else agree that the scene at the end when Frodo wakes up in the bed was kinda goofy? Everyone walks into the room one at a time and everybody just kinda smiles and laughs. Personally I think that if they would have either done this scene differently or removed it entirely, then they would win the Oscar for sure. It reminded me of some lame 80's TV show, where it would end by someone saying a really lame joke and everyone over-laughing at it, then it just freeze-frames. The scene was pretty bad, and I was surprised because the other 99% of the movie was incredibly great. I can't wait for the extended version."
"Some spoilers may appear:Jackson comes thru, even the removed sequences that he took out of his script do not effect the magnitude of this epic film.  The only weakness this film shows is found in its endings.  While Jackson actually truncates the many endings of this tale left by Tolkien, its still long and dragged out.  Im still looking forward to seeing the extended edition."
"-Minor Spoilers- I don't know where i have to start describing the feeling i had after the last line of the credits scrolled before my eyes on the big cinema screen. I was not able to turn my head and look at my friends who where cheering their lungs out. This is the best movie ever made (followed close by Lawrence of Arabia) and will probably stay the best movie for more than a few decades. I don't know how a director who made movies like, bad taste, braindead and not to forget meet the feebles is capable to make the best trilogy ever. This is not only a great book been made into a movie but a magnificent personal effort of Peter Jackson who made these movies the best they can be. Beautiful pictures of middle earth dancing on the score by Howard Shore, are being followed by the biggest and best cinematic action sequences i've ever seen. This movie will simply blow you away. It's better than the first one, better than the second one and even better than the first two combined. If you are reading this and haven't seen the movie, your wasting your time, rush out to the cinema and go and watch this. The movie is a great team effort with beautiful and intriguing acting by all of the characters. John Rhys Davies is even more funnier than in the two towers, Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan are showing that they don't have to be together to act. Sean Astin is interacting better to Elijah Wood than in the first two movies. And Elijah is the best Frodo in the whole world, you see it in his eyes that he's becoming more afraid every minute he is closer to Mount Doom. And not to forget Orlando Bloom, who's showing that he's a great actor with a facial expression that will make the Elfs proud. And then last but not least there is ""THE KING"" Viggo Mortensen which is a true king. There isn't a greater king than him. Oh, i forgot Ian McKellen, everybody knows he's a great actor. This brings me to the following conclusion. Rush to the Cinema and go and see ""The lord of the movies"" ""Peter Jackson"" i don't think you read this, but if you do, i thank you on behalf of myself and the rest of the Cinema loving world. Thank You Peter Jackson"
"Certainly not the best of the three. That place still belongs to ""Fellowship"". And as much as I hate to agree with nay-sayers, I believe there were a few too many endings for a theatrical version.However, the good FAR outweigh the bad - redeem them even.The effects are absolutely top-notch and perhaps the best of all the films. The battle sequences were astounding! Best I've ever seen.START MINOR SPOILERSMy biggest gripe is with the opening sequence with Smeagel and Deagel. Andy Serkis just played him like a mindless grinning goon. Instead of making Smeagel a little bit more ""hobbit-like"" with a normal speaking voice (not exactly the same as Gollums) and a more melancholy and serious side (not all child-smiles).END SPOILERSWhile I certainly agree that the film deserves some Oscars (but not director or film), I strongly disagree that Sean Astin, Andy Serkis or Viggo Mortensen deserve them for their acting. If anybody has earned a nomination for acting, it would be Ian McKellen and perhaps Elijah Wood.It felt almost like Mr. Jackson ran out of time editing and left stuff in that would have better found place in the Extended version.Still, this is an absolutely AMAZING movie. Perhaps I was just expecting too much.After first viewing, I give it 7 out of 10."
"...and so the story ends but it's a wonderful ride! Not giving any spoilers in this - only going to say: bring tissues and enjoy the amazing movie which Mr. Jackson gives us. Here's hoping he DOES manage to make the Hobbit, for this director/writer/producer is especially talented in making Mr. Tolkien's words into movies. 10/10 - in my opinion!"
"** Potential Spoiler **Didn't anyone else notice one major diversion from the book?! Why did the Army of the dead have to enter Minas Tirith. This goes against the grain of the book and detracts from the importance of such characters as Eomer and the men of Gondor. These latter are shown as wimps (especially with the total exclusion of Imrahir), and solely dependant on an army of dead guys. These were just meant to illustrate the irony where forces of evil are often defeated by forces they may deem to be allied by their very nature. In the movie, we have the battle going in full swing. Within a minute, in swoop the ghosts and out go the orcs!! Whooshhh.... so flat.Sorry Pete, but I had to bring this up! This was the only real flaw in the whole trilogy; all the other 'glitches' are just that. If only you had given us Tolkien's rendition here."
"(minor spoilers, but only if you haven't read the book.)some of the more awe inspiring moments for me were The Rohirim riding into battle at Gondor, Faramir leading his troops into Osgillioth against impossible odds, the moment Pippin becomes a man (so to speak), and the whole of Minas Tirith bowing down to four halflings, who might earlier have been dismissed as insignificant... it's moments like these that allow you to forgive the hollywood showboating of Orlando Bloom on the battlefield, and other such excesses."
"* May contain spoilers *After seeing this film, I was very pleased. The acting was decent enough, the effects were great, and the plot was well thought out. My only qualms were various discrepancies from the books, directorial decisions, and the occasional hokiness of the acting. After I while watching the Lord of the Rings movies, I've begun to feel that the only real men in the world have long hair, lots of facial hair, are about 6'3"", and speak like prize-winning orators all the time.None of this detracted from the movie at all. In fact, it made it more somber in some ways. But for the amazing amount of people who haven't read the books (which I discovered was a very large amount indeed), the movies may seem darker than meant to be. For instance, Denethor and Faramir concerning Denethor's insanity, that seemed absolutely unexplained in the movie. The book would explain how Denethor's possession of a palantir had driven him mad after excessive viewings of Sauron's armies, etc.The footage needed to explain this would have been seconds at most with few cuts, and I felt that the directorial decision to cut it in order to add lengthy endings was a poor call. You can't win them all, I suppose, but it's nice to dream. Otherwise, the movie on its own was phenomenal and I enjoyed it thoroughly. I recommend it to all, but be prepared for some slight disappointments if you have read the books."
"This film recaptured much of the feeling that 'Fellowship' created, and that I felt was missing from 'Two Towers'. The spirit of the story, the emotional engagement with the characters, the feeling of being part of the struggle in Middle Earth were back; and the areas in which the film differed from the book did not detract from it. There was a lot of action (enough to keep my action/adventure junky husband interested) but it did not overwhelm the plot, and the encounter with Shelob was really fantastic! I was sorry that they had to cut so much of the ending ... what happened to Saruman, the struggle in the shire and the aftermath ... but I understand that they'd have had to make 4 movies to include it all. I'm really looking forward to getting some of that back in the extended version DVD. Overall an excellent movie and well worth 3 1/2 hours in uncomfortable seats!"
they are right the third is best even if you dont think its possible go prove yourself wrong!*spoiler* the best part is the elephant scene especially with Legolas and Gimli.
"I just got home... and I must say that I am not as satisfied as I thought I would be.The film is very good... but, in my opinion, is far way to be considered the best of the trilogy.Both previous movies were more intense than this one.The battle scenes are awesome... but... the ""rest"" is very slow and quite difficult to stand for three and a half hour.The ending is boring... and that scene where Legolas beats a Mummakill... C'mon!!! What does an army stands for, if a single elf, can handle such beast ??????A third part of a trilogy which is in the 3rd place."
"A story with a history of huge proportions; the director seemed to settle for second grade quality. The movie was put out, advertised and expected to be one of monumental standings yet throughout it was riddled with bad special effects, terrible actors and a screen play that left much to be desired in the way of leading us into the world the author originally intended. A lot of revivals are being made, but the 'Lord of the Rings' epic should have been one to set itself above all others, and in my opinion this wasn't the case. I'm sure that even if JRR Tolkien wanted it to be made into a movie, which i doubt he would have, it should have been done to the best capabilities the film industry has."
"I have seen this movie and love it. I own a copy, and watch it often. In fact, I love the whole trilogy. Peter Jackson has done an excellent job portraying the books correctly. Elijah Wood also did an excellent job portraying Frodo Baggins. In fact, all the actors and actresses did an excellent job portraying each of their characters. Mr. Jackson did a wonderful job finding all the right actors to portray some of the most beloved characters in history. Some of my favorite characters are Arwen, Legolas, Galadriel, Gimli, Eowyn, and Sam. And although I'm arachnophobic, I love watching ROTK. Although I've seen the DVD version, I haven't seen the extended edition. But I think that the extended edition will make it even better."
"This episode of the series was the most disappointing, not because of any lack of eye candy, which was good, but for the focus and the changes made to the conclusion. I was really into the first film, the second filled in the important place between what should have been a great beginning and action packed end... This one fell short of the grandiosity I perceived in the books. Peter Jackson is brilliant in bringing the books to life as well as he did, but this was honestly over hyped. It was probably the ending that put the nail in the coffin. Being a fan of the books I expected something a little better, but it was perhaps my girlfriend of the time who put the right perspective on it likening the end-scene to a homosexual punchline."
"It's an okay film, epic and all, of course, the fact that it's an epic like Gladiator or Troy doesn't mean it's good, Troy proved that fact, and Alexander continued to prove it with one star antics.To be quite frank, Peter Jackson is an overrated director, much like the Lord of the Rings movies are overrated movies. If you notice, all three are located in the top fifteen films, this one happens to be ranked higher than greatly superiour films such as Seven Samurai; Schindler's List; and even Casablanca! This is not the case...With camera angles that make you sick, utilising the, admittedly beautiful landscape of New Zealand, to help push across into our heads the true epic feeling of Middle Earth. But wait! Where are the interesting characters? Every one of them you feel so bored with by the time the first film is up, you seem to hope that they'd be dead by the second one, but no, they come along to the third one to kick some Sauron ass.Here's my view of Lord of the Rings: A whole load of walking.Lord of the Rings- Fellowship of the Ring: *points* There! *walks* Lord of the Rings- The Two Towers: *points* There! *walks, trips up, walks on* Lord of the Rings- Return of the King: *points* There! *walks, throws ring into mountain, walks away*Take those completely identical scenarios and pile them up with useless plot for three to four hours per movie (depending on which one you watch, and I myself wouldn't touch the Extended versions...), you really get the idea that the Academy Awards truly are flawed. Why look! Forrest Gump won best film of 1994 instead of The Shawshank Redemption or Pulp Fiction! Titanic won best film of 1997 instead of L.A. Confidential! And, why, lookey here! LOTR- ROTK won best ****ing film of 2003 instead of Mystic River...Perhaps next year we'll have The Constant Gardener as the best film of 2005, that may actually redeem the Oscars' failing reputation, a reputation that had truly fallen when they took this half-arsed effort of a movie and worshipped it as ""Best Film""."
"A horrible conclusion to an otherwise awesome saga.The first two movies were good but the way Peter Jackson adapted this conclusive third film ended up having too many plot-holes.The first movie was amazing, and as it went on it went slightly downhill with the second; although it was still a great movie.This third just didn't keep up. I don't understand how it's the higher scoring of the three on many sites and praised... it was horrible in comparison.What about those ghosts? Why didn't they just go to the ghosts to begin with? They slaughtered everything. It was comical. Stupid."
"I'm just gonna say: A movie worth watching for a lifetime! This epic adventure is everything what every fan of such genre wants to see. Even after almost 20 ears, it's still watchable. It's even better. Why? Because the movie has the quality in every aspect. That was a time when special effects were not that much immportant, it was all about story teling, directing, acting, and living the movie. That's something what nowadays movies lack. Back then, they used dolls and costumes. And that, my friends, was much much better than special effect. Because it feels so real. For a moment you forget the fact that this is just a a movie. Like I said before, it feels so real. And I really miss those times. Times, when making money from movie was not number one priorety. But to entertain the audience throughout the world. :-)"
One of the best movies ever made with amazing battle's and good graphic. This movie is most probably the best out of the trilogy and is a great way to end it. The movie has great acting and a lot of answers to past story lines it shows the same great characters and contain death to a few main characters also. I would advice anybody who has not yet watched this trilogy to take time to watch it and if possible to watch the extended versions of the three it adds to 12 hours with the three (extended versions) but is worth every hour
"""This movie is one of the best pictures to explain a plot with Battles, Love, and the will to protect and fight. Aragorn will prove that there is a King inside him that is willing to protect the ones he love.Along with his friends they will save Middle Earth form destruction. Get ready for a thrilling experience that will last throughout the ages. I recommend this movie to anyone who loves when The Good Guys Win. Lastly, this movie is well constructed, it has a wonderful, heart gripping, attention grabbing, thrill seeking picture that one should have.Once you watch this motion picture, your life will truly never, ever, be the same and you will want to go out and join the adventure yourself. While as well finding it hard to believe that it is a movie, feels like really life. A movie one can relate to and enjoy again and again."" ""-Matthew Muse"""
"In my opinion, these one of the best film of ever. The reason is obviously the story: Tolkien is a master in telling adventures and this is his masterpiece; but the most important fact is that LOTR is not only an adventure: it is a great life's metaphor and the end of this trilogy complete the sense of life that Tolkien want to tell us: never stop searching for new experience, never think of having arrived, there is always something you can discover, and it can be both good and evil. The last image of the film, when Gandalf, the elves and frodo are leaving the middle-earth, is the perfect conclusion of the greatest and the most epic saga of all time."
"This movie is the third of a trilogy which starts off with The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring and then The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers and ended with The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King which is what I am writing about now and I believe it was the best out of the three. It was intriguing and mysterious, which is what I enjoy when watching a movie. It goes for a fair amount of time just like the rest of the movies in the trilogy but it is worth it and you don't get bored unlike what you do in other movies that just go on forever about non-interesting things with no action. If you enjoyed this trilogy of The Lord of the Rings then I highly recommend you watch the trilogy of the Hobbits."
"Ah, The Return of the King. A true masterpiece by Peter Jackson. These films have not only inspired me as a young director, but as a person. The development of the characters was beyond anything I've seen in other films, particularly the Grey Havens scene at the end of the film.The scene just tears me apart, to see these characters depart. The emotion of the hobbits really got me because you see just how much each of them went through, and the effect it had on them. The music did the scene justice and amplified the emotion to an even greater effect. The scene was simple, yet empowering. Gandalf always has the greatest quotes and to hear his last quote just had me grasping for air. It was an amazing conclusion to the films and Jackson definitely did the films justice with that."
"There seems to be a set line with movies. On one side you have the movies that are okay, nothing amazing but nonetheless okay. Sometimes people try to make a sequel but it either sucks or was just unnecessary.Then on the other side are the movies that are pure win. Epic, awesome, amazing. They capture the audience's attention. They are just perfect. And even better is if sequels are planned, they usually end up either as good as, or better than the original.Only a few movies have made it to the latter. Toy Story, Star Wars, Pirates of the Caribbean. This is another one of those.Despite the fact that it was intentional to have the same actors, and to keep the story to the book, regardless, the movie as itself was very well made. The first was okay, confusing but near the end I started to ""get it"". The second seemed to be slightly a filler, however it was still well done. This final one... wow.I got teary eyed several times. I rarely do that. I know it was suppose to end everything, and it did it perfectly. The emotions were captured perfectly. The story ended perfectly. The special effects were real, but weren't distracting.All in all, it was very well done, and I rate this 9/10."
"Haven't read the books yet, but considering how good this movie was,I plan to get them. In this final chapter, Frodo Baggins(Elijah Wood) and Samwise Gamgee(Sean Astin) continue their quest to Mt. Mt. Doom in Mordor to Toss the one ring into the fire to destroy the dark lord Sauron.Meanwhile Aragorn(Viggo Mortenson), Legolas(Orlando Bloom),Gimli(John Rhys-Davies), and Gandalf(Ian McKellen) Prepare for war against Sauron's horde of Uruk-Hai in order to buy Frodo time to make it the Mt. Doom.This film had Action, Suspense, Heart, and a great story. The acting was certainly Oscar worthy. Speaking of the Oscars, this film deserved all eleven it was nominated for, but I don't need to say that because it did win all of them. The only thing I didn't like was the extended ending which kind of dragged a bit. One of the best films of the decade in my opinion."
"The Battle of Minas Tirith, the March on the Black Gate, the Quest to Destroy the One Ring. Those are the elements which make this epic fantasy film THE best in the Lord of the Rings trilogy. It contains such an enthralling world of Middle-earth that for the lengthly period of time the movie takes place, you lose time in yourself to a world filled with mirth and magic. I think those fans of LOTR, Tolkien and fantasy should grab this movie straight away. Oh, and try buying the Extended DVD, it contains more scenes, Appendices and an Easter Egg below the final scene in the scene selection of each Disc.Definitely a 10/10.By HowlingRabbit334"
"I like the fantasy movie and specially like The Lord of the Rings.This movie in appear Legolas ! He is very handsome and quick in action He riding a shield, shoot an arrow to monster ! This is thrilling situation.and This movie appear Gollum. He's a successful role He's a dual personality..""My precious~ My precious~"" Gollum's line is very impressive.This appear movie in Battle,variety Magic, Monster etc.. and It was a very impression movie. also It was contained Love story!This movie is an exciting movie I'm recommend this movie :-D"
"If there was a rating higher than ten, this is the only movie in the world that deserves it. I say this with all seriousness. I loved this movie. This movie has everything anyone could ever want. Tolkien fans {I am one myself} and everyone else, will not be disappointed. For the very few people left by now who haven't seen this movie, DO SO IMMEDIATELY! :] Lord of the Rings is a beautiful work of literature, and the movie comes near to matching its brilliance. In the short documentary entitled ""Ringers, Lord of the Fans,"" someone says that the power of Lord of The Rings is almost spiritual, and I agree. Pete Jackson definitely captured the magic of the books, and you don't want to miss it."
"Pros: Great battle scenes, good score and directing.Cons: A bit too long, too many conclusions.Jackson's trilogy comes to a close with this nearly 4 hr spectacle (which is exceeded with the special edition) that serves as a great closer to the entire epic. Loose ends are tied and multiple conclusions are handled in a way that will please both casual viewers and fans. This outing is the best out of the lot, and Jackson proves that the third time is a charm after a somewhat lackluster second outing. For once, Howard Shore's score does not disappoint and the actions scenes aroused me for the first time since the troll sequence in film one. Did the movie deserve to win every Oscar it was nominated for? Yes, for it was recognition for what the filmmakers had accomplished with all three films, and no, for the fact that it wasn't the best movie of the year.Conclusion: Great but Jackson can do better"
"All of these movies were amazing, but this one is the best of the 3. It is one of the best, if not the best movie I've ever seen. It was filmed perfectly, the acting was dead on, and the special effects and battle sequences were mind blowing. The camera views were perfectly placed so that you can see everything that is going on throughout the film. Peter Jackson is a genius in my book. He deserves all the awards he got for the films. If anyone dreams of becoming a film director, they should try to model themselves after Jackson and this film. J.R.R. Tolkien is also a genius. The books and movies are so deep. He practically created a world with all the realms and people involved with it and how everything fits together. This is definitely a movie you have to see."
"In scale, ambition and extensive use of the latest CGI director, Peter Jackson's ""The Return of the King"" effectively brings to a close his awe-inspiring adaptation of J.R. Tolkien's legendary ""The Lord of the Rings."" Tying up the loose ends: Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom), Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) and Gandalf (Ian McKellen) prepare for their massive battle at Minas Tirith; Frodo's (Elijah Wood) mission to Mordor grows more dark and sinister as he nears the molten lava of Mount Doom; Samwise Gamgee (Sean Astin) confronts Gollum  certainly one of the most compelling bits of subtly nuanced computer animation ever.There are a couple of curiosities, including the inexplicable absence of Saruman (Christopher Lee) who appears in the extended version DVD but not in the theatrical cut, and the reduction of several roles that were previously rather weighty, now cut to mere cameo status. Jackson had a lot of ground to cover in this final installment and his editorial acumen was working overtime. The film is slick and polished, masterfully told and faithful to Tolkien's vision. Still, ""The Return of the King"" does tend to suffer from too many endings in its attempt to be loyally inclusive to all of the characters.THE TRANSFER: Stunning. No less was to be expected and no less is offered in this beautifully rendered picture. Truly, there is nothing to complain about in this anamorphically enhanced presentation. Colors are stylized, bold, rich and vibrant. Contrast and shadow delineation is nicely rendered. Blacks are deep, rich and solid with an incredible amount of fine detail present, even during the darkest scenes and battle sequences. The audio is 5.1 and extremely powerful. The rich musical score sweeps across all audio channels with an enveloping presence. Dialogue is very dimensional.EXTRAS: As with the previous two films, this one comes with a host of extra features, including three substantial documentaries (the National Geographic one being the best) and six extremely short ""featurettes"" which play more like extended trailers for the film.BOTTOM LINE: Is this the BEST PICTURE of last year? Arguably, yes. It certainly is a fitting conclusion to the trilogy and an exceptional DVD presentation for your home theater. Add this one to your collection today."
"The greatest movie of our time. Where to start? The story is perfectly realised through Peter Jackson, Fran Walsh and Phillipa Boyens' script, which is perfectly attuned to what Middle- Earth would be like. All moments, from epic battle scene, the best ever put to film, to the most human moments that can be. Theodens' death is handled with such care, Jacksn never allows sentimentality. Well maybe a little in the end where we are saying goodbye to everyone that we've spent 3 years with. Howard Shore's score crescendos at all the right times, and never overbears the visual feast that is being presented. All the performances are perfect, well deserved of the SAG Awards. Even Liv Tyler is good! But the whole movie would not work unless we believe in this place of mythical creatures and epic scenes of grandeur. And Jackson makes us. Instead of approaching this as a fantasy film, as any other director would have, he approached this as a human story with a fantastical backdrop. And this works only in its' favour. THank Peter Jackson. Thank you."
"The outstanding conclusion to an amazing trilogy. Movie making does not get any better than this film. As a hole the entire crew of LOTR made an amazing three movies, everyone did their job and everyone did it well. From acting to cinematography to costume/set design to special FX to sound FX to the music/score, few have done it better.The movie just completely engrosses you and cannot get enough, some people say that the ending is drawn out, I say that it ends the only conceivable way that I can see the movie ending (disregarding the Scouring of the Shire, it only turned out to be slightly upsetting).I am an avid Tolkein fan and I like to think that he would be extremely pleased with what Peter Jackson, Fran Walsh and Phillipa Boyens did in order to convert his story to the big screen.This film is a enthralling and a real pleasure to watch. It is just so good. Well deserving of every single Oscar it won."
"Spoilers for sure. A great film, but does it really deserve to sit in the top 250 at No3 beside the likes of Godfather 1 & 2 - I think not. The star of the show was a part CGI character (the future of acting??? again, I think not), and although sticking closely to the book, the closing 30mins were completely over indulgent and unnecessary.Hopefully the test of time will bring it down to a more respectable level, ironically, in line with the IMDb staff. An unfortunate consequence of an open vote where trigger happy teenagers are let loose to superhype. 7/10"
"I entered the film of the theatre expecting a tremendous film. My friend whispered in my ear ""Ready for almost the best 3 hours, and 20 minutes of your life,"" I exited the theatre feeling just that. It was the best 3 hours and 20 minutes i've spent in a movie theatre, the best film I've ever seen. It's epic entertained, how great it was. The acting was spectacular, and it some of the best scenes ever composed in there, the scene where Golem falls down with the ring is one of the best scenes in movie history. The Lord Of The Rings should be remembered as the best epic of all time. Plus, what some other films don't do, it stays true to the book, instead of cutting out a lot of scenes. Finally it's done. 3 hours and 20 minutes may seem long to you, but every minute you'll be loving it, you'll lose track of time, it'll go so fast. Just make sure not to drink to much water. 10/10, you can't make a better fantasy/ epic film."
"What won't be said about this over-exposed and somewhat over-glorified movie by now?It's fantastic that Jackson completed the series in tact, with great continuity, in an engaging fantasy -- staying true to much beloved books.[***SPOILERS AHEAD***]That said, Jackson arguably missed an opportunity to develop a movie that improved upon the flaws in the source books. The much-publicized never-ending story ending is just one. Making 45 minutes out of an appendix was more than a bit of a waste. And 45 minutes of crying, hugging hobbits tested my patience far too long.At the same time, I couldn't help but feel that these characters -- who had time to develop in the movie as little more than monster-bait -- made no emotional connection to me over the past 3 movies. And yet I felt wholly manipulated by 45 minutes of tears and hugging as if Jackson was trying to get an emotional response out of me that was never there to begin with. But at least it wasn't as horrid as the Star Wars Ewok conclusion...And then there's Lord Denethor -- written into the books, but a character whose self-immolation death wish for himself and his remaining son added absolutely zilch to the story and movie. But Jackson, staying true to the books, left in what was useless storyline fodder -- fodder that should have otherwise staved off my early rush to the bathroom by being left on the cutting room floor. My kingdom for an editor...That said, what's good definitely outweighs the flaws. A very good, albeit not great, movie."
"The third and final part of J.R.R. Tolkien's most celebrated trilogy is by far the best of the three films. Oscar winning director Peter Jackson has touched hearts and created many emotions in this outstanding ending to the film. Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) are near to Mordor, but are heading for danger by the devilish Gollum/Sméagol (Andy Serkis), the most convincing CGI character in film. White wizard Gandalf (BAFTA nominated Sir Ian McKellen), Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) have found Merry (Dominic Monaghan, now in TV's Lost) and Pippin (Billy Boyd) and are all preparing for war against Mordors many terrifying Orcs and other beasts. I can admit the ending does drag on with teary moments, but it still manages to make me cry. Also starring Liv Tyler as Arwen, Cate Blanchett as Galadriel, Hugo Weaving as Elrond, Bernard Hill as Theoden, Sir Ian Holm as Bilbo Baggins and Sean Bean as Boromir (flashback), no Sir Christopher Lee (at least not in the cinema version). This film won 11 well deserved Academy Awards (all nominated), equalling Ben-Hur and Titanic. These were Best Sound Mixing, Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Costume Design, Best Editing, Best Makeup, Best Music for the powerful score by Howard Shore, Best Song for Annie Lennox's fantastic ""Into the West"" (also won the Golden Globe), Best Visual Effects, Best Writing, Adapted Screenplay and Best Picture, it won the BAFTAs for the Audience Award, Best Special Visual Effects, Best Cinematography, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Film, and it was nominated for the Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music, Best Costume Design, Best Editing, Best Make Up/Hair, Best Production Design, Best Sound and the David Lean Award for Direction, and it won the Golden Globes (all nominated) for Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Original Score. Cate Blanchett was number 37 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Sir Ian McKellen was number 4 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, and he was number 5 on Britain's Finest Actors, the film was number 19 on The Ultimate Film, and as part of the trilogy, all three films were number 11 on The 100 Greatest Family Films. Outstanding!"
"The Lord of the Rings is an epic high fantasy novel written by English philologist and University of Oxford professor J. R. R. Tolkien. I believe that the writer consider religions for writing this scenario... using elf , trees, ghosts , orcs and a character like Gundolf (a savior) its like that you red and checked some religions like Islam and Christianity. Its like that Apocalypse happened and a savior comes to guide the survivors its the battle between Satan (The eye) and god (Gundolf and his allies) like the Apocalypse that holly Quaran and Gospel mentioned. The special effects of movie is great and all of the characters play their rolls perfectly. The story is very amazing that keep you tuned you like to follow every things till reach the end.

"Look, the movie was good. The best that can be done turning the compelling, but slow-paced and sprawling, Tolkein trilogy into a movie. I loved the books. I liked the movies fine. But I never understood the intense love-a-Thorn thrown to the movies - they aren't exactly masterpieces of anything but special effects (though the special effects were incredible). It isn't like there's any acting in the movie, and it isn't like they were somehow better than the books, you know? Its a fantastic movie. When I watch it 1st time, I was really shocked. Because I wasn't believing this film making. Thanks the movie maker. Also thanks the all artists of this movie. I think this is a idealism of movie making. In future, any one will interpreted for this movie. Again thanks all the artist and director of this movie. I hope that Bangladeshi director will inspire to watch this movie. And they will try to make as same movie."
"This film is the true first epic for the 21th Century and most probably the unbeatable for a very long time. The film is incomparable to the last two. Going a step further and passing audiences expectations throughout it's world wide release. It became a betterment for films today, because of its vividly enhanced and well founded characters including the credible and uncompromisingly harrowing visual effects, that even Tolkien would surpass today.The directors vision has finally been realised, Jacksons dominant role of being one of the greatest directors have come swiftly and within the day count from six years ago, Peter Jackson released a competence of pure ignition and fuel powered, emotional, gratifying and extravagant film."

"Alright, this movie can say that it has won a total of 11 Oscar awards. but does that mean that it is a good movie, no. i did see this movie in the theaters before it won all of the awards and when it ended i said to myself, that was a good movie. notice i did not say great like some readers may think. there is most definitely a difference between good and great, and the reason i say this movie is good is because the acting is once again superb and the music can not be matched. but it just left me wanting something. and that something was a more complete story. now i know that some will say it was based off of a book so what can be done to add to the story, but that is not what i am saying. there are just many parts that seem to be weak, such as the major battle scene. the animals looked great and the background looked fantastic, but when the ghosts just came into the battle and killed everything in a blink of an eye, i was disappointed. i wish that that part could have been better. and i know this has been said a million times but the ending really turned me off from this movie, because i feel that a great movie needs a GREAT ending. and the million and a half ending really left it feeling open and confusing. if you want a great movie, watch The Godfather or The Usual Suspects, because those are some of the greatest movies i have watched, and they leave nothing to be desired. for all of these reasons i gave this movie a 7 and that is exactly what it deserves."
"That's what these movies are. I've tried to watch these many times over the years, and the experience is always a painful exercise in eye rolling.I fully understand that there is no way the entire books could have made the transition to film intact, but the sheer amount of things changed for the sake of Peter's ""vision"" is just insulting. Even little things like the party's arrival at Bree was given an entirely mood for the sake of making it unsettling. Every event feels horribly rushed.The transition aside, the movie(s) aren't even good by themselves without knowledge of the lore. The acting is, for the most part, atrocious. The music feels largely unsuitable for the mood set by either the books or the films themselves, and also feels incredibly repetitive.Even the director's cuts of these films feel more like an insult than a tribute.I hate these movies."
"First of all, I do not consider myself one of those pompous ""I've seen 30,000 films, and I know it all"" reviewers, because I haven't, nor I don't. I went into this movie with the expectation of seeing the 4th greatest movie ever made (since that's were it currently ranks on IMDB)... perhaps that was my mistake.Never having read the books, NOR seeing the first two movies in the trilogy, I really don't think it should have been so EASY to guess what was coming up plotwise, as I did in 80% of the movie.  I am not a screenwriter, so in a movie as epic as this, I really should not have been able to finish sentences that the characters were about to speak as well. And am I the only one who thought some of these ""amazing"" special effects were downright cheesy?*********************** SPOILER *************************************** Hobbits lying unconscious, surrounded by lava.  Hmmmm. I wonder when their comrades are going to ride the eagles and carry them to safety... oh, there they are.  What really made me roll my eyes (which I did A LOT, considering this movie was over 3 hours), is the effect of the eagle picking up the hobbits. This scene reminded me of Dorothy being carried away by winged monkeys.  Over 60 years of movie-making later, and this still looked totally fake. ***********************************************************************Perhaps it would have been better if I had seen the previous two movies? No. It wasn't hard to figure out what was going on, which may or may not be a credit towards the movie.5 out of 10"
"I think that ""Lord of the rings"" series mislead the viewers especially the Christian viewers in indirect way, because these series promote magic (""good magic"") as a solution for the world & hints strongly that it's good to benefit from dealing with the souls of the dead people, & because these series consider that ""good magic"" not ""God's care & his miracles"" or any ""high good power"" is the only way to deliver mankind from evil. That ""good magic"" is done by ""Gondolf"" who is a wizard, a magician & a sorcerer! Who follow an unknown & invisible & enigmatic power; and also by fictional entities called ""elves"". I believe that there is no good magic, because every real magic is from the devil, the old serpent, the great dragon (Satan). So how evil can fight evil & win on it?"
"""I KNOW this movie is garbage"" -Casey Glendening and its an insult to humanity that it be ranked so high on the best films of all time. It is a boring cash cow for Hollywood only strangling real films from ever getting off paper and into the aperture. I would like to thank the academy for my opinion because they decide what is righteous and unmarred. I would like to thank the millions of non-thinkers who voted this so high and voted for President Bush. I know you must be all one in the same and statistics show you thirst for mindless violence more so than anyone else, so why not make a pointless three and half hour yawn fest your favorite film when the production studios final destination for bunkum such as this is a video game. Feel free not to have an opinion, just do what others tell you."
"The whole trilogy achieves to translate admirably well the deep boringness of the book, replacing infinite descriptions with long, empty, tired, repetitious and over-emotional sequences, totally misplaced considering the Britney spears-like deepness of characters.Characters are so flat and numerous, that you waste half of the movie trying to remember who is who, but it doesn't really matter anyway.Actions sometimes come to wake you up, they are mostly entertaining but the most decisive and very awaited one is reduced to a game-like greenish flow that is the only thing that happens to be fast in the whole movie.Be happy, the end is near.(Should be rated 5 to 7)"
"For me, this is film - making at its absolute finest. Its got everything, from drama, suspense and romance all in one. I saw this film at the cinema when I was in year 9 at school, and ill never forget the cinema experience of that night, I had goosebumps and tears all in one film. it was an end of an era for me. 3 years of superb film making. The other 2 films in the series are epic, but this one grabs it for me.

"the story is amazing but too long without mention the first story and the guy who is the lord of the rings (evil guy). the nice from the writer to mention all kinds of people without mention the human kind as he try to say the humans are not the only kinds on the earth. the ""hopet"" story is nice to continue as separate film to try to explain who they are ? where are they came from? there movie will be better if there writer focus on evil part of story. who create the rings and where are other rings ( the movie mention only one but its name "" Lord of rings"". which increase the power of rings "" dispear only is not Enough."

"Well, then that would be the difference between subjectively rating things by opinion or objectively rating them by points, or in the case of movies by Sales or bums on seats. In sports, the ""best"" or better teams can often lose just as the better movies can get less bums on seats than the dross. Hence mediocre teams can win cups. The real rarity is great films that put bums on seats. The ""Best team wins"" scenario and that is what I believe you have here. A great film that people went to see. There will always be people who are so desperate to be noticed and to be different that they will say the best films (objectively or subjectively) are crap or ""over-rated"". But that says more about them than the millions who think otherwise."
"The best of film history. The three amazing movies. There are many and great movies that you can liken this magnificent trilogy. But somehow, Middle Earth has something special, something that grabs you in it and there are no words to describe it. I feel like a part of it, and at the end of the day, that should be the goal of every writer and Mr. Tolkien was not going to be less. A penalty is not assessed at the Oscars to ""The Hobitt"" as it deserves, but hey, we all know these ""big prizes"". The best of film history. The three amazing movies.

"Absolutely stunning film from start to finish.Peter Jackson does a fantastic job flowing the story, and the pace of the film is perfect. The acting is superb, playing the characters with style. Staying as true as it can do to the original story, I got several shivers down my spine in scenes as I did when reading the books. This film is also visually stunning and Peter Jackson finishes off the trilogy in style. The effects are smooth with the CGI not over the top, it's just right and extremely realistic. As a Lord of the rings fan I may be a bit biased but this is truly one of the best films I have ever seen.All of the Lord of the Rings films get a 10/10 from me but if there was a rating of 11/10 for The Return of the King i would give that."
"""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy made by Peter Jackson is easily one of the best fantasy flicks ever made. Not only the visual aspect of those three movies surpasses any single fantasy movie to be released before this film, but also the story was magical, captivating and unforgettable, with great characters, excellent performances and beautiful music.This was one of the most incredible films ever made, I think those three ""Lord of the Rings"" flicks are the greatest achievement in all the history of cinema, and the only movie to be almost as good as those movies was ""Avatar"" from James Cameron.""The Return of the King"" is the excellent third (and last)part of this great trilogy, and shares all the good elements of the two previous film. This movie was excellent from beginning to end, being epic, emotional and thrilling. The battle scenes were memorable and magnificent: The ending was perfect and closes in a satisfying way one of the greatest movie franchises ever made.This movie is magnificent, and it is one of the best flicks ever made."
"The Return of the King is the final volume of the Lord of the Rings trilogy of films. This film continues the journey of the odd group of companions consisting of Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom), Gimli (John Rhys-Davies), Gandalf (Ian McKellen), Frodo (Elijah Wood), Sam (Sean Austin), Pippen (Billy Boyd), and Merry (Dominic Monaghan). The story picks up where ""The Two Towers"" left us with Sam and Frodo continuing their journey to destroy the ring of power and the rest of the companions fulfilling each of their individual destinies elsewhere in Middle Earth. The film climaxes during the battle at Minas Tirith, the capital of Gondor and the implied final stand for the world of Men. This film embodies the ""good vs. evil"" theme in one of the most effective applications seen to date. Much like ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" and ""The Two Towers"" this film offers incredible writing, cinematography, and editing. The use of setting and sound in this film really deliver the feeling and emotions that the productions staff intended. The setting of the film is Middle Earth, a fictional realm and is really the mountainous regions of New Zealand. The scenery offered is awe inspiring and definitely makes one feel as if it were not from this world. The sound in the film is full of emotion and purpose. You know exactly who is bad, who is good, and what their purpose in the story is just by hearing the sounds offered. Some of the battle scenes have you tricked into thinking you may actually be there. This film sets the standard for the modern day epic battle between good and evil. The characters are well thought out, developed and allow the viewer to develop and almost personal relationship with them. The film is incredible almost any way you analyze it, from the basic components to the acting and beyond. It is a film that any moviegoer should want to see, whether the like fantasy or not."
"I thoroughly enjoyed the lord of the rings movies, with the exception of the last hour of the final film. Of the three films this was quite honestly the weakest, but it was still a pretty good movie and worth the price of admission. There is a point at which things become too ""feel good"" and commercialized and the last hour of this film more than crossed that line. 60 plus minutes of goodbyes, elves huggin (frolicking in bed together is a little weird but OK), just to wrap up the story. I like the movie but not enough that i want to watch elves kiss goodbye for an entire hour, it was just plain boring not to mention uncomfortable. The reason i say this film is more commercialized is that in all super popular movies things become less about the story and more about ""cameos"" from all your favorite characters which makes me think of them as marketing tools and actually takes away from the character (think xmen). anyways it really is worth a watch, but do yourself a favor and just turn it off once the conflict has been resolved."
"There's really not much to say about this movie, other than it is the best movie ever made. Well, it may be tied with The Godfather. Anyway, beyond the amazing cast, magnificent special effects, fantastic score, and stellar sets, this movie actually has a great plot. Thanks, J.R.R. But really, I've read the each book more than once, and this is one of the only movies that I can really say that the movie is even on par with the book from which it is made. Granted, they have taken some liberties with the script, but there is so much in the books that it is to be expected. For those of you who think it is too long, I recommend reading the book and finding out how much longer it technically should have been.The third movie is the best one just because it wraps everything up so seamlessly. I'm a sucker for happy endings, and this is like the ultimate. Thank God Peter Jackson went to New Line and did three movies instead of staying with Miramax who wanted him to make only two. This movie is, in all senses of the word, epic."
"This is one of the best movies I have ever seen! Anyone who loved the first two, or is a hardcore action fan should see it. It's so good that it stands well on it's own ( though it will take people who haven't seen the first two a while to get into the story). It's definitely a satisfying ending to a good trilogy. Spoiler Warning!The Battle of Pellenor Fields is the most mind blowing battle scene in Movie history! The elephant fight was definitely something you don't see very often. You're always wondering how the good guys are going to beat that. Though it isn't really what happens in the book, it's very exciting and awesome nonetheless. An awesome movie!!!!"
"1) What is your favorite Character in the ROTK ? for me it is ....... SAM2) What is your favorite moment in the movie ? for me it is ....... When Aragon bows down to the hobbits 3) Will there be a movie in the near future that is a continuing soga for Lord of the Rings 3 ?4) At the ending of ROTK when Froto decides to go with the elfs, where exactly is he going. I know it is some forever place. But does any one know any more about the place he is going to ?5) In ORDER, put the 3 LOTR movies from best to worst in your prospective... for me its ........ Number 3 than Number 1 than Number 2"
"So here we are at the end of all things. ROTK is the best of Jackson's LOTR trilogy. It was very very close to the books. Acting is superb. The only problem I had with it was Gandalf beating the snot out of Dethenor. It just seemed so out of character. Other than that, this is the year's best picture. Screw cold mountain and all that other americanized junk. This is the film that deserves best actor for Elijah Wood and Viggo Mortensen. Sean Astin so deserves best supporting actor as does the magnificent Andy Serkis and Ian Mckellen. It deserves best visual effects, best adapted screenplay and of course best director and best picture! IT IS PHENOMINAL. I loved it so much I cried twice. What you say? A man can cry during a film? Oh my god he must be gay! To all you homophobes out there I wanna say please grow up! If you haven't seen this film yet, please GO!!!!!!!!"
"I've just re-watched The Lord of the Rings trilogy for the 1000th time tonight... nearly 15 years since the Fellowship of the Rings was released... I still haven't seen a movie that's better, nor close, to any of these three films. The casting is perfection as well as the incredible acting by everyone in the movie. I can still watch these movies back to back and not get bored. They are a light to this world and wouldn't be the same without them.I miss the good old LOTR's days. The best movies ever created. The Return of the King was the best way to end a thrilling journey through middle earth!"
"This movie is the best of everything, the charaters are the best with each other and their environment.  You have to love the pros, as well as the antags.  This movie as one reviewer once said of this movie, it is the best movie of this generation! The saddest part, it is the last movie.  The only thing I have to say that was a downer, it needed more epic battles! So, my top 5 have now changed: 5=Scarface,4=Matrix,3=Lord of the Rings 3,2=Godfather,1=Citizen Kane."
"The high rating of this movie baffles me. While it had superb special effects and above average acting, it failed miserably in telling the story. I was extremely disappointed. I adored the first film in the trilogy, understanding that you cannot include everything in a movie that is in a book. The second film was also excellent, although it began to try too hard to be important and profound. This last installment was intensely boring at times as it strived to be profound. This could have been a great movie, as it so often depicted scenes according to my imagination. Unfortunately, while describing the world it lost the essence of the story. The movie seemed to lose its way not only with pace, but with its heart. This marvelous story of extraordinary effort by the gifted and those less so to face head on an evil of incredible proportions went astray at too many crucial points. Granted it hit the mark in places, but it in others it almost seemed to take the credit from the valiant and place it solely on supernatural and circumstance."
"In short, a very, very good film which would have been the trilogy's best and have gained a 10, had not it not gone on so long. I get the feeling Peter Jackson didn't want to end the series, and so made the final film last as long as humanly possible. In the end it just gets tiring.I really will not be watching the extended version, which may well stretch to five hours. Why couldn't they just do a Kill Bill on it?Oh well, I don't want to try to put you off, at 7/10 it is still well worth a watch, just don't try to watch the whole trilogy at once. Not without a family-sized KFC bucket, at least."
"I think those that have described both this movie and the trilogy as the 'greatest ever' should go back to their video games.  In time, all three of these movies will take their rightful place in film history...oblivion. 
I can't understand how people can equate special effects with great film making.  There's really nothing positive that I can say about these movies except that the special effects were at first stunning.  Soon their repetitiveness led to utter boredom.I would much rather watch a film about realistic situations that people can actually relate to.  But I guess if you spent your entire life playing video games and watching other special effects based movies like these, then these movies would qualify as the greatest ever.Someone made the comment that this movie was better than Citizen Kane. Watch this movie as many times as Citizen Kane and see which holds up better.  Believe me, this whole trilogy will be a fading memory in ten or twenty years and Citizen Kane will continue to be praised.  This is just another case of the 'dumbing down' of the culture.  These same people probably can't wait until the next Superbowl so they can watch the commercials.I generously gave all three movies of this trilogy a 5/10."
"I watched the Fellowship & could live with the changes. The Two Towers made my heart sink too many alterations & additions, yes additions I can understand cutting the story to fit but shovelling lumps of extraneous storyline in that is not in the book WHY? extra elves at helm's deep WTF! Why cut bits that those familiar with the books are expecting to add garbage that no-one expects I can't explain. The Return of the King was for me the last straw, the Return of Jacksons Ego more like. Why they saw fit to change dialogue from the original, in some cases only a few words & in others changing the speaker of the words.This is Peter Jacksons LOTR not Tolkeins, I haven't checked but the credits should show ""inspired by JRR Tolkein"" because this is not his work.I will stick with the BBC 4 version, which While abridged is true to Tolkein & the pictures are better on radio."
"I had such high hopes when I first heard that a Tolkien fan was going to write and direct a live-action+CGI version of Lord of the Rings... ... only to have them cruelly dashed.FOTR was a bit rough but I said to myself ""It'll only get better"".  Boy was I wrong.I suppose the main problem is twofold.First, Jackson is way too young/inexperienced to have taken on this project. He certain has ability but he has a lot to learn about filmmaking before even thinking about tackling such an ambitious project.Second, for alleged lovers of the source material, Jackson and company took WAY too many liberties with the story.  Changing them in pointless and even foolish ways.  Perhaps this was inexperience, maybe it was just laziness or a lack of understanding of the source material.Goodness knows that LOTR is far from perfect as an example of storytelling but there is a great tale buried in Tolkien's massive tome.Too bad that Jackson and his crew were absolutely unable to bring it to the screen.  By the TROTK, Jackson's exhaustion is practically oozing from the screen and he's lost sight of many key elements of the story."
"A movie shouldn't be elevated beyond it's true value simply because of special effects.  All three movies had exceptional special effects.  They were amazing.  The realism is unbelievable.  However, superfluous additions to, and needless omissions from, the original story, along with quite a bit of over-the-top acting are certainly enough to move it quite a ways down the list.  This movie is not better than Schindler's List.  It's not better than The Usual Suspects.  It's not better than many of the movies it's currently beating in the top 250.  This film is currently rated higher than The Seven Samurai -and- Citizen Kane.  Let's vote the real value of a film and not destroy the value of our system.I rate this film 8/10 in it's genre for exceptional special effects and a great soundtrack."
"I was rather hyped for the third part of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, as I suppose everyone was. Unfortunately, I found it boring and lacklustre. The Return of the King barely exhibited the epic quantity that I awaited from the finale of the trilogy. It seems that by this time, the whole crew was tired of the project. Also, the omissions and changes to Tolkien's original are most glaring in RotK. The movie just whizzed by and I failed to be impressed. Maybe the Extended Edition would prove to be a more rousing experience. The normal edition, however, despite its efforts, remains a lacking ho-hum finale to what began as an impressive filmatization of the Lord of the Rings tale."
"The final installment of Peter Jackson's incredible trilogy showcases the brilliance of himself and his crew. Every aspect of the film brushes close to perfection, from the incredible performances of the cast to all the work done behind the scenes and in the studio. This grand conclusion of the tale of the One Ring highlights the talent and hard work of everyone involved in the production. Middle-earth truly comes to life through this masterful film, ushering in a new and greater respect for fantasy films. The magnificence of Tolkien's writings are wonderfully translated to the screen through the minds of Peter Jackson, Philippa Boyens, and Fran Walsh. Middle- earth's beauty is caught by the brilliant eyes of legendary cinematographer Andrew Lesnie. A story told so beautifully, ""The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King"" will likely be forever known as one of the greatest films of all time."
"This film was compelling - it kept you watching. The spectacular backgrounds and both strange and interesting characters are all attractions. But the storyline is basically rubbish. I haven't read the books myself, but can only imagine them to be terrible as the story by itself is poor, and only works with the images to support it. This story is fantasy that isn't quite convincing. I didn't feel that you got to know the characters at all which made you feel distant from what was happening. I'm not a particular fan of this genre, but it can be effective if it convinces you that you are there and that it is real. I would watch this film, purely as something to fill a couple of hours. Long movies are always hard to keep at a good standard the whole way through and often drop down in your ratings, within the last half hour. This is why I give it a 5, because it really is in the middle. Nothing very bad, just nothing to shout about."
"I suppose that someone, sometime, may tell the story more accurately but I doubt very much that it will ever be told better. Nothing could ever replace the books for pure escapism but Peter Jackson has managed to evoke both the feel and texture of Tolkien's masterwork without pandering, too much, to clichéd Hollywood extravagance. The cast are superb (if Sir Ian Mckellen is remembered for nothing else other than Gandalf I feel sure he would not complain), the cinematography stunning and the pace, even over the 8/9 hours for the whole trilogy is matchless. For those who have read the books (as I have for many years) I would suggest watching once to get all of the niggling storyline changes/omissions out of your system then just watch as a pure, wonderous, unadulterated piece of epic, EPIC cinema. I'm sure I will love it forever."
"I think that this movie is overrated, it's a great movie, clearly worth seeing, but it's overrated, to ment people hasn't read the book by J. R. R. Tolkin and so they think that the end of the story is like it is the movie, but really there are missing about one hundred page from the book, that in the book are some of the best part I think, when they return to the shier and finds Salomon how has ""destroid"" the peace in the shier, it's a great part of the book, and it isn't in the movie. In the movie they are just retuning to the peaceful shier they leaf, and Tolkin is in the book trying to say (after my opinion)that there personalty chanced a lot, and also did the world around them, so he tried to say that, you aren't the only thing that chance in your life. So I think that Tolkin is turning in his grave. Not that Peter Jackson didn't make a great movie that will go over in history as one of the best, I just think he leaf out a very important part of the story. I gave it an 8, I think it's fair."
"Obviously this was a faithless and pointless butchering of the novel, but what's worse, a terrible movie.  Lacking flow, sense, linearity and dramatic impact, this played out like a highlights reel, not a coherent story.  The actors did an admirable job with the awful dialogue and nosensical personalities they were given, with some exceptions.  Peter Jackson's only two abilities seem to lie in super close up and super wide out shots, both of which are heartily abused.  And the special effects, for the most part, would have been better served by a cardboard set and some directing ability. There were high points, but this was and is the first and only movie I have ever left before the end and they barely kept me there but for the Eowyn-Nazgul scene.  A hollywood blockbuster?  No Doubt.  A good movie? Hell no.  Possessing anything in common with the literature it is supposedly based on?  The fact is, if this were based on real events, I don't think the people involved would have given them to right to use their real names. Maybe that wouldn't be such a big deal if I didn't have to hear about Jackson's love of the books, or read reviews that discuss staying true to the source material.  There is hardly a scene or underlying theme in the movie that has anything to do with the books.  This movie could probably have been worse, but I would be hard pressed to know how..."
"This truly was the epic trilogy of our generation. It was done perfectly and will have a nice little slice of film history to go along with it. I have one gripe about this movie, It's high rating. Sure, this was a good film that brought the story to a completely satisfying end while still making the audience want more when the credits rolled. It was a good movie.But to say that something like this is even able to compete with such films as Pulp Fiction, Psycho, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, or even the original Star Wars, then you are gravely mistaken. This was a good movie to watch, and definitely defines the term epic. I do believe, however that people rank this film too high. It's not even close to the greatness of any of the aforementioned films or even Fight Club or Dr. Strangelove. You LoTR freaks really need to stop voting for no reason. Shawshank beats the hell outta this one as well. Maybe people will wise up."
"and poor characterization.As a technical achievement it's a masterpiece.  As a work of drama, it's mediocre to lame.The dialogue scenes were overwrought with drama, much like a soap opera, although instead of sappy Hammond organ music, we had the sappy orchestral score, rising and falling on practically every syllable.Jackson deserves a lot of points for his technical skills but none for his artistry."
"Congratulations Peter Jackson. Plenty of imagination is required to try and pull off a trilogy such as ""Lord Of The Rings"". Not to mention a country like New Zealand to film it in. It was just such a shame it was so boring.Now I admit I struggled through ""The Hobit"", and never gave ""Lord Of the Rings"" a chance in the paperback department. So I applaud your effort of keeping me a little interested throughout the movie. One of the two things that bothered me was the ridiculous length of the movie. I have three words that could have saved this movie from becoming a joke. POST PRODUCTION EDITING. I was laughing in the end at what a farce the movie had become. Perhaps the biggest disappointment was nothing to do with the movie but JRR Tolkien, who came up with surely the worst idea ever written on how a victory could be one. Writers block or just a cheap cheap sell out. You decide."
I thought this was a very good movie. Very well filmed and acted with amazing sets and scenery. My only complaint was that it went on too long. It should have finished at Mount Doom the rest of the scenes were not necessary.
"As a movie virtuoso, I have seen nearly over hundreds of movies dating back as far as the mid 70's. However, it is sometimes difficult to find a movie out there that is worthy of anyone's 95 minutes of their day. With all the nonsense, exaggerated, repetitive, and culturally degrading pieces of work out in the movies today, I can come to agree with that. However, as many titles that may leave your eyes bleeding, there are some that leave not only your eyes, but your ears begging for more.In Summer 2003, I was already impressed by the opening trailers to the icing of the ingenuity cake. I had no idea how much better the presentation really was until I walked into the theaters that Winter, only to be overwhelmed by the beautiful opening music as the title was being presented. 'The Return Of The King', focuses on many life ordeals at the same time keeping it's creative fantasy structure into perspective. Troubles such as betrayal, deception, disloyalty, greed, and malice are all shown in this work, showing how our lives can relate to a world so very different than reality. Not only did the flowing dialogue allow viewers to validate the setting similar to the medieval ages, but that the soundtrack used in this masterpiece was not only original, but absolutely beautiful and astonishing. The instrumentals along with the vocals throughout numerous scenes in the film, made it so much worth watching. It had almost been as if someone had made a visualization of an epic poem and combined it with an exciting and interest-grabbing plot.My recommendation to this film is pretty strong. This film has definitely earned it's 11 academy awards as well as it's box office high. I can clearly say this film, inspired by Tolkien's brilliant novels, is one of the most exquisite and most beautiful pieces of literature turned into a pure illustrated masterpiece.Bravo, Peter Jackson, bravo."
"Let me explain the action sequences in the first two Lord of the Rings movies. In The Fellowship of the Ring, there wasn't much action, just mostly running. In The Two Towers, it was fighting without much gore included. The third was simply mind-blowing with amazing fight scenes, and pretty much all the violence you could imagine. Don't get me wrong, violence truly isn't everything in a movie. But this had excellent special effects and fight scenes. This is a movie that will thoroughly spend 200 minutes of your time, and it's usually hard to find a movie like that. This movie is rare, adventurous, and enjoyable. Not a kid's movie."
"The one thing Jackson did here that was a HUGE move away from the norm ... notice that none of these DVD's have any trailers for other movies in the beginning of the DVD or any other BS that you have to go through before getting to the actual menu - these three are the only ones out of 200+ DVD's that I own that I can just put in the DVD player and actually be able to watch them without a 5 minute BS runaround of having to try to fast forward through all of the ads and trailers - most of the DVD's out won't even let you access the menu until you watch these forced advertisements ..... I am sure Jackson lost a TON of money by boycotting these things that everyone hates - it is just another example of how he made these excellent movies not for himself or a production company, but for the people that love watching them ... it is very unlikely, but it sure would be nice if others would take a few lessons on philosophy from Pete Jackson - bravo for looking after the people that pay the bills instead of the ones that make all the money from them"
"It's a really great masterpieces has a great story.the other two were great too.Peter Jackson is a great director you would say.You, I mat him one year ago at Hollywood. He said about his feeling of the movie.And he said that he think that movie did great and everyone will like it for generations and forever.After that,I started to work at the east Brunswick library to broadcast the channel three news.Anyway, the movie is like a really great action,drama,and adventure movie to watch.It's not like the first two movies, It's better than the other. So, for all you movie fans out there, I hope you have a great time on IMDb.com."
"Unlike previous letdowns this year, Return of the King was excellent.  A perfect 10.  Coming in at 3 and a half hours, the movie is really long...but until the last 20 minutes you really don't know.  The plot, acting, effects, and story keep people glued to their seat the entire time.  Sean Astin deserve atleast a nod, if the statue as Best Supporting Actor Oscar. Elijah Wood could recieve a nod for Best Actor.  This movie will definately win Best Effects, Best Musical Score, and could win Best Movie this year at the Oscars.  It was that good.  You should go see it, right now.  Stop staring at the computer screen and go.  This movie is that good."
"Don't get me wrong, these movies are very well made. It's amazing that these books were actually made into films in the first place. It takes a lot of vision to accomplish that. However, as a film or even a trilogy, there are several fallbacks. Firstly, there is a lot of unneeded dialogue. Secondly, after the audience waits for the climax and then the rundown at the end of the film, the movie doesn't end. It feels it needs to tie up loose ends that most audience members won't see, such as what happens to Bilbo. All in all, the vision deserved the Academy Award, although as always, there is room for improvement."
"i don't get the point with all that:11 Oscars, 9/10 on IMDb.. but WHAT? this is sensed to be something artistic? some postal card landscapes and ridiculous one liners, damn try-to-be intelligent scenes about loyalty and all... there is NOTHING in this movie nor in the two others that can let me say it is a good movie. no plot, no acting, no directing. there is nothing in this movie, and i don't post that to provoke reactions. i truly think it and i don't understand to be so isolated with this point of view. There are well done heroic fantasy movies, like Conan the barbarian, that are seen like average movies and THIS is put on a podium... i hope i'm not the only one it makes wanna puke..."
"This movie only makes the top 250 because the average movie goer was wowed by the nice digital effects and the nice (if somewhat boring) cinematography. However, this movie had no story just as so many critics have stated about Tolkien's trilogy (please check the reception history of Tolkien's novels if you don't believe me-- I teach English). Tolkien was a mediocre writer at best and this trilogy translates into a mediocre bore-fest. I have never seen more effort put into such a boring story. Tolkien's 3 tomes could have been summed up in about five paragraphs but it seems that Peter Jackson is just as long winded as JRR. These three films have about enough story material to make an interesting short film. Jorge Luis Borges would have been horrified to see such a travesty of pointless, long-winded storytelling."
It's the best movie I have ever seen I've always loved watching it many times I don't get tired of watching this film There is everything in this film is a legend in every sense of the word All the characters more than wonderful This movie made me to i be ambitious in the world of cinema and representation The funny thing is that this film made me watch all its parts more than 30 times It's the only film that I loved it and I will not forget him at all.. I thank everyone on this legendary film.. All movie scenes are wonderful ..we will never see such a wonderful movie never.. I say thanks thaks thanks about this movie I don't have words to describe expressive Just I wish that you will continue in a new industry chains of the film
"The epic conclusion to this outstanding story.I have never watched a series of films that have been made with utter perfection that as you stare at the end credits, you are left in awe of the pure brilliance of Peter Jackson's work - reflecting on what you have experienced throughout the trilogy.The combined flawlessness of the the acting, the script, the filming, the special effects and, most importantly for me, the music have made this film a rarity of unmatched excellence that sets the bar for all other films.An outstanding achievement in film making that should be seen by all. A 10/10 for this film along with the previous two."
"To fully appreciate the greatness of this movie particularly and the trilogy as a whole, you have to watch the extended version of it. I saw it on TV first and then got the extended version and since that, every time I watch the standard version it seems like a compact version of the real thing. The regular version is amazing but the addition of some important (at least for me) scenes makes it the best movie of all times.This is by far the best of the three because of the fact that it had to tie all the ends and finish the story and at the same time be bigger and more intense that it's predecessors.While I still think that the last 15 minutes of two towers is one of the greatest masterpieces in the history of mankind, you'll never be disappointed in this one. The trilogy itself is just so deep and so perfect, that it's one of those things that make you think about the beautiful things humanity is capable of."
"It is a great pity that people cannot distinguish between great works of literature and the failure to exemplify these works in the cinema graphic medium.These three films adapted from the great work were shot on low quality film and in a manner to make the greatest profit from as much exploitation of its artisans as possible. For example Peter Jackson knew that he could New Zealand Citizens to be extras at no costs due to the novelty of under taking such a project of this magnitude and glamor in a parochial isolated hometown New Zealand Countryside.Peter Jackson, Fran Walsh and Philipa Boynes bought the film rights of the great literature for a massive cost and then hired scriptwriters to prepare the screenplay adaptation in their names at great cost. This was a very poor screenplay if you really loved the books and actually read them which most of the films audience probably never could or did. How the motion Picture Academy members voted it best screenplay adaption and gave the award to these three people is rather suspicious.The cinematography was very poor with many shots out of focus and overuse of various camera techniques. This has been supported many Cinematographers in many blogs.The acting performances were very mediocre and the selection of actors was purposefully chosen from Australians and New Zealanders due to Peter Jackson's view that they are better actors than Americans and the British. In fact Australians and New Zealanders have this strange dislike Americans despite consuming their films.The animations of various creatures was so similar to the vampires in ""dusk till dawn"" it makes you wonder if the CGI people had much imagination. The many gratuitously violent scenes, not described as such in the books, would have been very frightening to children let alone the ridiculous characterization of the Golum. In fact most of the CGI was carried out by Americans hired by Peter Jacksons multi-million dollar CGI suite.Which at the end of the day makes you wonder where Mr Peter Jackson got the money to not only buy the film rights to the books but to build a multi-million dollar film effects studio in New Zealand.The whole thing was obviously a massive profit making exercise in profit making with Peter Jackson and his mates securing huge merchandising deals in the planning of the project.It is further proof that the very wealthy and privileged can always demonstrate what their money can achieve not what they themselves can achieve due to any talent or real imagination.It was not made for the sake of love of a great work of literature but for profit and self aggrandizement. I fully understand that films must make profit but this one really couldn't go wrong with the material and the present day innovations in CGI. I am certain that one day someone will remake it and do it properly and maybe some one like John Boorman who was originally going to make the film.I am so content in thought that there is a great difference between people like myself and the people who glorify this film and Peter Jackson."
"I have seen a lot of movies made from computer programs, Lara Croft, etc.. However, this computer generated cartoon beats them all. No, nobody really gave a great performance individually or they would have got a nomination and won it no doubt. But the graphics, oh man, they almost looked like a real movie being shot. Moreover, the special effects were incredible. I can see why this movie won seven Oscars for special effects alone. I mean, you have to give it to this movie, it had some great special effects. Oh sure, the acting was overdone and a bit sappy, but man, get a look at the special effects here. I mean, it won 11 Oscars, so I guess it must be the best film ever, even though nobody from the film was acknowledged for their performance, because nobody was really great in it, but man, the special effects here, outstanding. Hey, a billion geeks can't be wrong."
"I love the Lord of the Rings, all 3 included.  I love the epic, extremely long nature (3 hrs+ each) that really allows the viewer to become immersed in the world.  That being said, as much as a movie like Braveheart is extremely under-rated for its amazing acting, directing, etc, Lord of the Rings is conversely overrated exhibiting in many instances very poor acting (Gimli anyone?), a weak translation of the book (the books blow the movie away), and truly subpar directing regardless of what the academy or any one of you fools may think.  LOTR could have been a truly epic masterpiece if directed and acted accordingly, however it still remains a very entertaining movie even with all of its flaws.  Albeit, in ten years it may unfortunately only be remembered as the most overrated movie in history (4,5 all time!!!!, are you kidding me, that is absolutely rediculous!!)  which is really a shame for such an ambitious fun to watch movie."
"The Lord Of The Rings is the best trilogy ever made in my opinion. There is not a single flaw (maybe from book to movie, but I haven't read the books, so I can't say). This series is so perfect. Not only is it for anyone from 9 to 99, but it's just so touching.The Fellowship of The Ring was an excellent movie, probably the slowest one, but you gotta have patience. The Two Towers ups the action and excitement and after I had seen it, I was craving the 3rd one so bad. But when this film finally hit theaters and I saw it, I knew that it was the perfect movie. I cried, I gasped, I jumped, I cheered, I laughed, I clapped, I did everything.This movie will honestly stay in my heart forever. A true example of a perfect movie."
"This movie has to be the best ever film made out of Hollywood. Not many people at the start of this trilogy of films would believe it was made in Wellington, New Zealand.Peter Jackson, a kiwi himself, has made many movies in his time and with the help of the cast and crew, has made this his most popular and successful one yet. He knew the book and is a huge fan of Tolkien's work, so this film was going to be a handful filled with so much action and battle, but I feel he has made one great job, and has proved that some things aren't impossible.Unfortunately, I haven't read the books myself, so I don't know what has been missed out or added to make this movie. But from what I have heard from fans of the books, its not a bad copy.""The Return of the King"" has got to be my favourite out of them all, for the fact it has everything- action, romance and every now and then a bit of comedy.Jackson must have thought hard about who was going to play what part and how he wanted it played, and I cannot see any other actors in the roles- they are PERFECT!All that's left to say is that these films are the best made ever!!!!"
"One of the greatest triumphs in movie marketing has finished (or has it?). Regarding all billions of dollars there must be more to come.
It's very difficult to understand all the fuzz about this trilogy. The plot is told in an average way, you have seen all the effects before (many, many times) and the acting is really no acting at all. Yes, it's entertaining in a way professional action movies mostly are. Cut the first hour and the last half hour and keep the battles. That would do this a perfect movie for twelve-year-olds.Yes, many things are professionally done on the screen here and you surely don't feel like you've been sitting in the same chair for about 3,5 hours. But once again. What's the fuzz?"
"I can't believe this movie won so many Oscars. Sure it was technically sound and all but damn was it boring. This is one of the few movies I have been tempted to walk out of. The last movie I walked out of was Spawn if that gives you any idea how little I enjoyed this movie. Its not that I don't have the attention span, some of my favorite movies are ""7 Samurai"" and ""The Great Escape"". I think we have all been brainwashed or maybe just starved for a good fantasy movie to come along.Anyways, for all the technical achievements and production value I give it 6/10.Please don't make ""The Hobbit""."
"Amazing special effects have been used to mask Peter Jackson's mangling of the original plotline and script.  Warning- this film is a prime example of a brilliant book being 'Americanised' i.e. hammered into the boy meets girl, girl loses boy, boy and girl reunite format.  It has a couple of elvish words thrown in to preserve an illusion of adhering to the original book, but with Aragorn's American accent often intruding, this performance is hardly spell-binding."
"This movie is great for family movie night because it has something for everyone, small children might be scared by some scenes, but overall it is a good family movie. The action scenes are all shot and feel authentic and unlike in most action- driven films the acting in this film exceeds all expectations and is fantastic. J.R.R. Tolkien's series was in safe hands with director Peter Jackson who made sure to remain authentic to the text while still bringing the story to life in breath-taking detail. This is a must watch for any fan of the books or movie buff. The only downside to this movie is its length which is understandable due to the amount of material that needed to be covered. However, don't think you'll sit down for an hour and a half and finish the movie. You'll need twice that amount of time. So you have been warned."
"Watching this beautiful creation was one of the most glorious things i have ever witnessed in my life. There is virtually nothing wrong with this masterpiece, literally everything has been pushed to its most absolute limit, the actors, the music, the script, the direction, costume design, cinematography, editing, everything is perfect, everything is beautiful, definitely one of the best films ever made, a colossus amongst films. The number of times i stood amassed with a tear in my eye while watching this beauty is astonishing, i'm sure everyone knows about the Lord of the rings by now, i'm only doing this review for s#!tt$ and giggles. Truly this is one of the most epic films ever in cinematic history."
"You do not need much to understand the movie to understand what Jackson did a herculean job, starting with a rigorous selection of the actors and ending with realistic scenery, computer graphics skillfully diluted. That came to an end, the greatest, ambitious and epic story of Middle- earth. All three films have flown in the same breath, despite the fact that going for 3 hours. I'll be very bored through Middle-earth, Shire, will miss on all the characters, and of course will never forget this great trilogy. I will definitely reconsider. It's so epic, big, exciting, touching film that just simply absorb the viewer completely. I never tire of praising the entire production team, each person put his hand in creating this trilogy. All 11 Academy Awards, have been obtained absolutely deserved. The film is made up of an incredible amount of detail, all those who participated in making the film the big fellows also like to mention the excellent music by Howard Shore, who sinks into the heart. Those who are of Middle- earth was not enough, I suggest to get acquainted with a new trilogy of Peter Jackson's ""The Hobbit."""
"The movie was spectacular. The trilogy cannot be described in any word nor any string of words put together to form a phrase or anything else. It was unbelievably impressive. Starting with the movie, once again, the acting was phenomenal. The emotion evoked and the empathy one feels for the characters is truly sincere. It's amazing at how a movie can be four hours long, yet not feel as if it was more than three, or two and a half. The visual effects are incredible. The trilogy as a whole is unbelievable; marvelous; stupendous; phenomenal; you understand what I'm getting at. It is a true tale of friendship and love. It's an adventure all throughout; not only for the protagonists, but the viewers. The effort put into the whole thing is just shocking. Each movie was released one year apart of the other, and they're all over 3 hours long. The script is great and so is the directing, and everything else. There is no way this trilogy can disappoint. Definitely worth the eleven hours you put into watching it."
"This movie is an instant classic. Everything about it is perfect - the acting, the special effects, the plot, the music, and the complete and utter emotion it contains. It will be remembered for years to come and its story will be passed down for generations. I have seen hundreds and hundreds of movies, and this one will always be my favorite. This is the movie I will show to my children and tell them how great it is until they tire of hearing about it from me. I have grown up reading the books and this movie did not disappoint. Nothing else has come close and nothing ever will. I hope for everyone to enjoy this movie and cherish it as I have and will. Kudos, Peter Jackson. Continue to amaze and inspire us with your work."
Greatest fantasy movie of all time. I have watched it at least 63 times and can't get enough! best movie Of all time 10 out of 10. The movie is a masterpiece made by a master of film. The only bad thing about this film is that it does not go for long enough..... 3 hours is to short for a movie. My favorite character was Aragon because he is the definition of badass. Legolas was also badass but gimli was lacking in badassness but that is was defined the characters. Peter Jacksons sneaky cameo appearances in these movies were also another highlight of the best trilogy of all time. Overall I rate this movie a 10 out of 10. If you have not watched this movie then I spit in your general direction! I like turtles. #HALAMADRID
"It couldn't be another better ending for this wonderful trilogy. All the work is fantastic but this third part of this story couldn't be better. Congratulations to all the team.I had read the trilogy's book before watching the film and I thought in a epic history, that is how it has been, I was not wrong.So, the only more thing I can say is, if there is someone that has not seen this film yet, don't wait more. Also, I recommend the new trilogy based in the world of J.R.R. Tolkien, called ""The Hobbit"", It's awesome.Perhaps, one of the most important point to have made this film the best option, it has been the choice of the environment. Simply amazing."
"This was my first movie ever.I mean it when i say that i have never been interested in jack squat before watching LOTR(yes,the caps is important). I saw it in Bahrain first in Budaiya,for those of you who don't know where Bahrain is,FYI beautiful place,must go. Anyways,I couldn't believe the story line and the details of the characters and where they come from as well as their homelands,it's a completely different feeling whenever i watch it but I will always have that feeling in my mind that i'm watching something worthwhile( which is better than what's out there now,with one question.What would've happened if i never saw this movie?I told my best friend at the time and no surprise he got hooked too.I think anyone in the world will agree with me when I say that LOTR is the greatest and most respected Movie series accompanied by of course The Godfather.Just ask Aguero.(And i'm an Arsenal fan)"
"This movie is just as great as the three before it. The camera angles, lighting and effects were amazing. I am so proud of the actors, Viggo, Orlando, Elijah, Ian and everyone else! Without this amazing cast, Lord Of the Rings would not feel the way it does. Andy Serkis, props to you for your amazing portrayal of Gollum and all the effort to get all those jumping shots in. The camera crew showed their worth with the excellent filmography. Ever angle gave meaning and ever sound effect chilled you with pride. With all these factors I feel proud to be alive when beautiful films like this are made for us to enjoy. Intense nostalgia grabs me when I watch this film now and I couldn't be more happier."
"This movie is epic. It takes the best of the book and increased to become something great. All the characters are well embedded, the drama of each is well explored. Viggo Mortensen is the perfect Aragon. Better than fellowship of the ring. Better than the The two towers Tolkin rest in peace. Because your job of your life was not thrown in the trash Peter , you are the guy...This movie is epic. It takes the best of the book and increased to become something great.

"I just wanted to say that for a long time i thought it was just a crappy fiction movie but i was completely wrong. It's the best movie ever made (: The Lord of the Rings is a fairy-tale of myth and fantasy. Peter Jackson directed a film that was considered, for a very long time, impossible to make, and not only for technical reasons. The narrative roots are incredibly long and detailed, and the storyline is deeply connected with the creation of a fantastic continent from a time unknown called 'Middle Earth'. It's author, Tolkien, dedicated a considerable part of his life developing this continent's background, it's mythology and origins, it's different kinds of people, cultures and languages, and therefore it's geographic references are determinant to the unfolding of the story of the One Ring."
"The fact that I can repeatedly sit through a film that is over 3.5 hours long and still be fully entertained is somewhat of a wonder to me. There are some movies that I cringe my way through, or am so bored that I check the time and can't wait for it to be over, but not the LOTR. This movie perfectly captures the world that Tolkien created by combining several flawless elements that work to make this one of the best movies ever made. The acting, cast, CGI, wardrobe, and general attention to the simplest of details are what makes this a truly magical movie. From the mountain of books in the background of Bilbo's study, to the rust and grime on the armor of the Orc berserkers, it's the painstaking attention to detail that makes this movie endlessly re-watchable, and timelessly beautiful."
"With the final installment coming through, everybody can recognize the greatness of not only The Return of the King, but of the trilogy as a whole. Despite not being a fan of ""fantasy"" movies, i was completely taken by the magic of the story, and particularly Peter Jackson's incredible ability to transform such a complicated story into an epic movie, and raise the scales of film making. The Return of the King grabs audiences and places them in with the characters, one by one. It is no surprise at all for the movie to swap 11 Oscars, and we all surely will be looking to the upcoming two installments of The Hobbit to see if Peter Jackson can outdo himself. Rating: 10/10"
"Peter Jackson's ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy is a monumental achievement, I won't argue with that. The sheer scope of the project and the fact that Jackson was able to wrangle it into three blockbuster and seamless films is cause for admiration.But it's a monumental project that left me cold, and if you're a movie goer who's made to feel like a pariah by the series' idolatrous fanboys for not thinking it's the greatest thing to ever befall our civilization, give me a shout, because it would give me comfort to know there are others out there.After nine hours of Elijah Wood's one expression of wide-eyed bewilderment; of Viggo Mortenson's uber-sombre line readings; of Orlando Bloom's silly hair; and of relentless gray and brown battle scenes, I'd had enough. I think it says something about your endeavor when the most interesting character in the film is the one who's computer animated.The person who really deserves the most credit for this trilogy is its editor(s), who had to take god knows how many hours of footage and shape it into something resembling a movie.Grade: B"
"""The final battle for Middle-earth begins as Frodo and Sam, led by Gollum, continue their dangerous mission toward the fires of Mount Doom in order to destroy the 'One Ring'. Aragorn struggles to fulfill his legacy as he leads his outnumbered followers against the growing power of the Dark Lord Sauron, so that the Ring-bearer may complete his quest,"" according to the DVD sleeve description, this final installment was the ""Winner of 11 'Academy Awards'."" The conclusion of writer/director Peter Jackson's majestic realization of J.R.R. Tolkien's good versus evil epic adventure ""The Lord of the Rings"" continues to inspire awe; ""The Return of the King"" is another state-of-the-art motion picture, with the expected mind-blowing special effects and battle scenes. As you'll see (or not), this chapter falters somewhat, after the more tightly-constructed ""Two Towers"". But, at this point, criticism is pointless. In conclusion: ******** The Fellowship of the Ring (12/10/01) Peter Jackson ~ Elijah Wood, Ian McKellen, Viggo Mortensen, Orlando Bloom ********** The Two Towers (12/5/02) Peter Jackson ~ Viggo Mortensen, Elijah Wood, Sean Astin, Andy Serkis********* The Return of the King (12/1/03) Peter Jackson ~ Elijah Wood, Sean Astin, Viggo Mortensen, Billy Boyd ********* The Lord of the Rings (12/10/01-12/1/03) Peter Jackson ~ Elijah Wood, Viggo Mortensen, Sean Astin, Ian McKellen"
I have thought about this since the first time i saw the Lord of the rings (the return of the king 2003) why is this movie not number 1 on IMDb it was three for the longest time and recently just dropped to number four everybody who voted for this movie should have given it a 10 (excellent) there should not have been one person on IMDb who should have given this movie a 2 or lower. This is my favorite movie of all time and also it should be everybody's else's favorite movie of all time. Plus it had a great director (peter Jackson) who had also done King Kong (2005) which was also a great movie i think everyone else should agree with me that this was one of the best movie's ever made.
"I will never forget this trilogy¡ Jackson's directing achievement can't be measure¡ special effects, cinematography, make up, costume design, sound, score, editing, screenplay, actor's performances ... everything in it's right place. I'm sure lots of people all over the world feels the same about the movie. Ian McKellen is Gandalf, he is not just an actor... He really became the white wizard¡ Mortensen, Wood, Weaving, Bloom, Astin, Blanchette, Tyler ... what a crew¡ I read the book four years ago, and i just could't believe that images from movie matched perfectly with my imagination. I wish this movie make directors and producer of Hollywood assume new challenges¡ God save the King¡"
"Best movie, of the best fictional world ever made, no doubt that this movie and the franchise itself are marked on the history of movies as the books are, Peter Jackson did a great job giving life to the marvelous work of J.J.R. Tolkien, even going a little bit further than Tolkien in the character development, in resume: 10/10"
"So there's two trilogies I watch over and over again, year over year and sometimes even more than once/year. The Lord of the Rings trilogy and the Swedish Millennium Trilogy (Girl with Dragon Tattoo).Lord of the Rings, Return of the King is my favorite of the three because it's on an epic scale of film-making that we'll likely never see again. From beginning to end, the story-telling, location, dialogue, character development, direction, acting, costuming, set design, cinematography, you name it, all of it is stellar in this film. I was in love with the books and this trilogy, similar to Oplev and Alfredson's Millennium films, adapted to the books in a spectacular way, as to be rendered in a class of their own."
"Without a single doubt, 'The Lord Of The Rings' is the best film trilogy ever, and 'The Return Of The King' is the best of the best, and in my opinion there is nowthing better than this film. It's dramatic, tense, climactic, exciting and just sinply wonderful, which is everything you want in a film. Peter Jackson has earned the name of my favourite film director ever."
"There are many reasons to Lord of the rings to be the best trilogy, some of them is:It was written by Tolkin:Tolkin was( in my opinion) a genius, he created the most beautiful fantasy world and one of the most detailed (even more than I'd like);The movies are loyal to the books:Most of the trilogy was faithfully constructed of books, of course some details needed to be changed to make a good movie, but nothing too big."
"Perfect wrap up to a wonderful trilogy. This movie, though set in another world, sheds light on the power of hope we so desperately cling to in our own reality. A wonderful blend of superb acting and brilliant script-writing. It is very relatable, however fantastical it may seem, no human wants to be vulnerable and this movie shows that truth."
"Great finale that does justice to this masterpiece. It is difficult to find a single flaw in the whole series and the last movie in the trilogy is no different - from exceptional actor's performance, throughout the wonderfully made environment, to the heart moving story-line (including the finale). I think Tolkien would love this, just as every movie lover does. Thank you Peter Jackson for making this happen."
"Honestly if you haven't seen this movie yet why are you wasting your time reading reviews go watch it immediately. Granted it's been at least a year since I last watched the LOTR trilogy but I can still say without a doubt this is the best one of the three. In my opinion is was much more satisfying than the hobbit trilogy as well. Also you don't have to be a fan of fantasy or anything (which is unlikely in the age of GoT) to enjoy this movie, I guarantee anyone would enjoy this movie as long as they pay attention.Easily 10/10"
The best part of the trilogy.I enjoyed as I watched this movie. It's so good I can watch over and over again. Definitely the most emotional part of the trilogy of the series. It's too bad the movie is permanently ended.I wish to record another part of this film.
I watch all movies (about 12 hours) in one shot every year. I have movies and all books. I read all of them. I never bored because this world is amazing and magnificent. Thank you Tolkien and thank you Peter Jackson I will watch with my sons and grandsons.I watch all movies (about 12 hours) in one shot every year. I have movies and all books. I read all of them.

"Let me tell to whoever is viewing this review. This is a MUST see movie series. But, The Return of the King stood out the most to me. Perfect beginning, perfect halfway through, and perfect ending which I will not say. This movie has been out since 2003 and if you haven't seen it by now, it's never to late. For Frodo!"
one of the greatest movie i have ever seen its squeal to LOTR two tower the actors are amazing and also the story its amazing its contains lots of goods scenes u have to watch lord of the rings trilogy before u die and thank u peter Jackson for this great movie there's no good movie like the lord of the rings basically the lord of the rings trilogy are amazing and also i hope you like it
"Definitely the best film in the Trilogy.Like many Tolkien fans though I was disappointed by the details left out only to find that we'll have to wait for the DVD gouge to get them (hopefully), but it still an absolutely breathtaking film.A friend of mine commented, however, ""Someone shoot that damn violinist"", and its so true. Every time the Violin starts its a tear jerking moment ;)"
"The ending trilogy was intense and compelling but not quite perfect.  A reality-based motif would have even brought this imaginative fantasy.  The eerie, haunting black corridors of Mount Doom and the pervasive evil as well as presence of heart-break female roles were missing.  Such magic would have captured a the Excaliber quality essence of Middle Earth.  The music, the dizzying reeling battle scenes, the cinematography were richly transferred to the screen.  Yet, the epic nature of Dr. Zhivago was never fully realized but as a fantasy it is the best to come along.  Eight out of ten stars."
"The acting is amazing, the emotion unnerving, and the climax of an entire two years is here.  I believe the nominations for Best Picture have been hints that the final episode of the Lord of the Rings will receive it at last.  This film is a masterpiece, filled with every emotion, from fear to comedy, and everything in between.  Some have said it dwindles.  I disagree, if you think of the resolution being too long, just remember that it's the resolution for the end of three 3+ hour movies.  It's pretty much expected to have a long resolve.  But I do agree that all of these films are a wonderful representation of the books, and the Academy should seriously consider this as all of them combined in one film, and just give it an award.  Anyone who's casually interested in movies, books, or just fantasy in general will enjoy, if not love, this movie.  Highly recommended, notably honored."
"Despite the 3 1/2 hour running (my only complaint), this is a great ending to the Lord of the Rings trilogy.  This is the final battle between good and evil in Middle Earth.  I hope this is the year Lord of the Rings wins Best Picture and Peter Jackson gets Best Director at the Oscars.  I think this year's competition is weak.  If it doesn't win, it will be a travesty. All three films are a remarkable achievement and should be honored.  Honoring the last of the trilogy would be good."
"Let me start off by saying that this is absolutely the greatest movie I have ever seen ... I will admit I am biased by my love for Tolkiens written work and Jackson's cinematic epics, but I truly feel that I cannot think of any single film that can top this film, in any way ...
I believe that the definition of the word ""bittersweet"" certainly has to come with the viewing of this movie. A long-expected conclusion, but nonetheless sad goodbye to a film series that has touched the lives, I truly believe, of millions.I think the only proper thing to do, since I really can find no words to describe the perfection of this movie, is to give thanks to everyone involved in creating them. I don't know if anyone from the films reads these comments, but if you do, I know I speak for millions when I say that you have succeeded beyond any other in bringing so strong a tale to life.To the actors and actresses, thank you for bringing life to the characters and making them beloved in our hearts. To the set artists, your visual masterpieces have been flashed into our memories forever. To the musicians, vocalists, and Howard Shore, your score plays on forever in our ears. To Peter Jackson, your vision has extended far beyond the borders of film and into the very hearts and souls of your audiences. To the writers, Fran Walsh, Phillipa Boyens and Peter Jackson, you have layed the foundation of a film series that will conquer the disheartened everywhere. And lastly, the greatest of all thanks to J.R.R. Tolkien, the man who deserves no lesser title than the spinner of dreams.And if you have not ventured out into the world of Tolkien, it's about time you went there and back again ..."
"Granted, I didn't read the books, but oh my god, how can people say this movie sucked?  One of the best epics to ever grace the screen, concluding the best trilogy ever to grave the screen.  Unbelievable movie."
Great job on all of the movies in the Trilogy.  I read the books back in the sixties and fell in love with them and read them over and over again. Yes at times the movies have differences from the books but I don't think anyone could have done a better job.
At last it's been released.  The most awaited and most hyped movie in recent cinematic history has finally hit the screens.  And it lives up to every bit of it's expectations.  Mr Jackson managed to excel himself again.  The visual beauty and the emotions of this movie are epic. The actors seemed to hold out their best interpretations for this movie. Sean Astin is incredible.  And it is certainly one of the better movies of Elijah Wood.  His critics have definitely been silenced.The visual beauty of the movie and the special effects are breath-taking. This time the action has been timed and directed to perfection.  Did you see that spider?  And how the Ringwraiths grow on you?  And the Paths of the Dead?As always WETA have done an excellent job in costumes armoury and other props.Well done Peter Jackson
"This movie was a masterpiece, Peter Jackson did a brilliant job! It was very touching... I knew the end and I still cried! The way he portrayed the characters and events was fantastic... The movie is definitely the best one of the year!"
"This is the best of the trilogy, and I am glad that It ended so well, I think that this movie will have the critics buzzing again when it comes to Oscar time. This movie will shape the way other movies advance over the next few years."
"After seeing the third Matrix and finding it very disappointing I was a little worried about the Return of the King.But I worry no more.The final chapter makes this the best movie trilogy of all time.  Although all the movies stand on there own, the synergy of them all working as one cohesive picture is spectacular.This is the best movie of the year by far and is amazing as the concluding chapter. So many series fail by the final chapter such as Godfather 3 and Matrix Revolutions but this series just keeps getting better.I give this movie my highest recommendation."
"ROTK, one of the most anticipated, and hyped, movies of all time is finally here.  Was it worth the wait?  Does it live up to the hype?  In every way imaginable.  Usually when a movie has this much expectation there is no way for it to live up to what we have already envisioned in our minds. Incredibly, ROTK exceeds those expectations.  When all is said and done, the LOTR trilogy will likely go down in history as the greatest ever made.  A perfect 10."
"This movie sets the benchmark for the genre.  The attention to detail, the fantastic views with the timeless story are very well matched.  Peter Jackson and the cast draw you into Middle Earth, the camera and special effects crew make you believe in it and care.A fantastic transfer from the book!  It's such a shame it's now finished..."
"This is an amazing film. Having read the books, I was very interested to see how Peter Jackson would finish off the trilogy....just BRILLIANT! I can't think of any words positive enough about this film. The action sequences are unbelievable and more. The battles are astounding. And, the acting superb. Elijah Wood and Sean Astin portray the relationship between Frodo and Sam brilliantly. This is just an amazing film, that deserves all recognition it gets. Just amazing...."
"Usually I don't want to see a movie more than once in a theater let alone a movie this long.  But I just want to see it again, as well I can't wait for the extended version to come out on DVD.  However i know that it will be a while with how good and popular it is."
"The anticipation leading up to this culminating epic only made it that much more spectacular when this movie delivered on it's amazing hype. This is undoubtedly one of the most powerful and well-directed epics I have ever seen. I was amazed with the cinematography and the brave journey into the psyche of Gollum/Smeagol. Mortensen was a lot better in this movie than the other two, and the same can be said about Elijah Wood and Sean Astin. The development of their relationship is particularly moving. The only complaint I have about the movie is the drawn out ending. I'm not familiar with the books so I'm not exactly sure if this was necessary. Oscar gold should finally come to Lord of the Rings in the major categories (Director & Picture) & it should reprise it Cinematography win from 2002. This is an absolute must see.-James"
"The third installment of Tolkein's masterful trilogy explodes to life on screen in ROTK.  From the intro flashback scene to our final farewells I was literally on the edge of my seat.  This film is like a rollercoaster ride at mach 1.  My only small complaint is that I could have gone for an extra 10 or 15 minutes worth of Legolas and Gimli, they felt slightly underused. All in all one of my favorite movies of all time!!!"
"That was one of the best movies I've seen so far... I give it a 10.  Peter Jackson is a genius.  Some parts were really emotional and almost made me cry, especially the end, when I realized it was the last movie of the three. It's kinda sad that it's over."
"This film is going to be a classic for years to come.  I don't think I've ever seen a better movie.  The special effects were eye-popping, the acting was superb, and the plot was seamless.  I enjoyed the depth they gave to Gollum's character.  I was stunned by Sean Astin's heart-wrenching performance as Sam.  He did a fantastic job of making the audience feel strongly about this story.  The film deserves every star you can give it."
"I cannot say enough about this movie.  I just sat through it, and despite some leg cramps, it is well worth it.  I was completely mesmerized every moment of it.  It is intense and beautiful and funny and flows effortlessly from scene to scene.  And the end ties everything together so you are not left wondering about anything.  The cast was amazing.  They all played their parts to perfection.  I highly recommend this movie.  I really do believe it is the best movie I've ever seen."
"I have enjoyed the LOTR trilogy as much as anyone, but the computer graphics got a bit out of hand for my tastes in this one.  The sets are fantastic, but they could've worked a little harder on the special effects to make them seem a bit more real.  Aside from that, I wonder how someone can easily breath sulfur gas, wonder why stories must be so tidy, and remember that intermissions are a good thing.  I loved the film, but a few things make it less powerful than the first (which I rank the best of the three), but a magnificent film and story, nonetheless.  Bring dinner and a pillow.  8 of 10"
"The Return of the King is a magnificent movie, all on its own. Peter Jackson is a brilliant director. How he managed to put all of Tolkien's words into the screen is wonderful. I actually finished the Lord of the Rings books (including the Hobbit) 3 years ago. It was painstakingly difficult to read through intricate descriptions and words but all in all, it was a good (though some parts were snoozeville) read.And the movie is even better than the books. Great movie with great actors... truly a film to be remembered. Way cool."
"There's only one word which could describe this movie better than any ones else: perfect! The score is perfect, the directing is perfect, the script is perfect, the story is perfect, the actors and the visual effects are perfect!!!"
"This film is so brilliant i wasn't embarassed to cry, the effects are outstanding, and by far the most amazing I've ever seen. If people want to say that this film is ""nothing like the book"" then i challenge them to do it any better, the film is the best it can be to stay true to the book, Ok so bits were in a different order at times but this kept it more interesting for those who have read it, the acting quality was superb! Viggo Mortensen was amazing! and Sir Ian MCkellen was perfectly cast, as for Orlando Bloom well he's already made his mark on the world."
"Everything I expected, and more. It was a roller-coaster of emotion - everything from the fear in the tunnels to the feeling of glory in the battles, and the sadness at the end. Easily the best of the three movies!"
"Fellowship and Towers were great, classics! Return of the king was, I would have to say... better!  I think they created a truly great Epic by shooting them at the same time.  That in itself really led up to the final chapter and how ""real"" it was.  Though the last 30 minutes could have been cut to 15, I understand why they did it.  That is a lot of book to fit into 3 movies...  Don't walk, RUN to see it.  If for no other reason, see it on the big screen...  UNBELIEVABLE!!"
"This may well be my favorites movie of all time for all time, and the longest of my favorites too.  Somehow I found myself in the choice middle seats at 12am on the 17th.  Despite being sleep deprived after exams and work, the movie kept me alert, neigh, riveted.  I recommend this movie over any other fantasy.  The CG will have my respect forever, as will Peter Jackson and all involved.  Let me say Thank You to Tolkien, Walsh and everyone that made this movie possible."
"Best work of cinematographic genius I have witnessed to date. Simply amazing all around. To truly understand the workings of Middle Earth, one must read the book itself. However, this is the best I could possibly imagine this amazing literary work being translated into a film. No words give this film justice."
"Never have I seen such a overwhelming movie as this. Beautifull landscapes, enormous fighting scenes and great buidling structures. I read the book and even in my imagination I could not have dreamed that it would be possible to exceed these thoughts. Perfect special effects, impressive visual effects and a good mix of emotions in the different scenes. To bad, this is the last part."
"How could anyone put into words a description of this movie? It may sound sad but it touched me so much I was in tears for an hour after I saw it. It was the most touching, heartfelt, spectacular, story I have ever seen in the Cinema that I don't think even the words I used just now do it justice... All I have to say is it is DEFINITELY the best for last, the special effects and stunt work was beyond this world and just the way everything flowed and how true the characters were was just magical to watch! If I had to recommend this, I would say GO AND SEE IT MORE THAN 5 TIMES!!! YOU WILL LOVE IT!"
"I don't know what else I can say.  The film is beautiful beyond words, and I feel like a better person for having seen it.  I finally feel like I have seen the movie...to me, The Lord Of The Rings is one big 11 hour movie (Extended Editions) , and it has been incomplete...until now.  An epic that will most likely never be equaled.  Out of sheer respect, the movie deserves to win Best Picture, Best Director, Best Supporting Actor (Sean Astin...he's incredible...one of the better supporting performances ever) , Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Editing, Best Sound, and more.  Bravo, Peter Jackson. And thank you."
"I thought the first two films were great and then I saw Return of the King...  somehow this made the first two even better while at the same time making them pale by comparison.  This movie is beautiful, breathtaking, exciting, thrilling, heart-wrenching, awe-inspiring, heart-pounding, and humbling.  The movie stands for itself and words are not fit to descrribe it.  This is the film by which all others should be judged!"
"I can't believe that this fairytale of lifetime could be turned as movie like this, this was much better than my imagination produced when I read the books. This was unbelievable, so near perfection. Thank you :-)"
"Been there - done that!  Over 9h watching Lord of the Rings! Awesome!Just arrived at home again from watching the 3 films. Amazing! Really fantastic! But it seems to me that the Second Part (The Two Towers) comes up with more fighting scenes and action than the third. In my opinion the third film can't ""beat"" the second - but he has other advantages. But nevertheless the third part is worth watching it. It`s just about finishing the triology. Jackson did a very good job - not too much of action, continuing the love story(s) and bringing on the dramas. I'll watch it again on Saturday!..."
"well what can i say, this has to be best movie ever made. the scene peter jackson changed is very nice done. those ""tolkien purists"" shouldn't even complain, cause it's SIMPLY impossible to make a movie the same as the book. get a life or something.  i've also read everything of tolkien, but why would you hate on a movie just because some detail isn't in the movie!!!! just like you(purists)can make a movie like that lol.i would rate this movie a 10+ and the whole triology also a 10+"
"I just came back from a special viewing of The trilogy (1st, 2nd & special premiere of the 3rd movie) in Rotterdam and it was incredible. I sat in awe for 3 hours and 20 minutes and my jaw literally dropped when the big battle started. Never could I have imagined that someone could produce a battle of this magnitude on the silver screen. The big orcs (or whatever they were), the oliphaunts, but especially the nazgul with their terrible screaming were awesome.But the most important thing is that Peter Jackson put the story about friendship and unselfish sacrifice perfectly on celluloid (with many, many thanks to the script-writers). What a movie!!!! Thank you Peter!!!"
"This movie is awesome... Its some of the best I've ever seen. I've never seen a movie as good as this, I couldn't keep my tears back, and so could not 4000 others in the cinema, Oslo Spektrum, at the before-premiere... In five words: As all movies should be!"
"If you liked the first two movies, then you'll love this one.  As with the others, the cinematography was excellent and the battle scenes will leave George Lucas with deep-seated special effects envy.  The acting seemed to convey more emotion and urgency, and the movie itself maintained a better pace than the previous two.  The musical score, however, seemed somewhat less inspired.  Hopefully the extended edition will wrap of more of the loose ends (you'll know what I'm talking about when you watch the movie).It not only gives a satisfying end to the trilogy but raises the standards of excellence for science fiction and fantasy movies in general. Congratulations to everyone involved with this production, as you did an excellent job."
"This movie is groundbreaking. We've seen the good acting, heard the brilliant soundtrack, and have been banned to our seats by the amazing movie making before. Without spoiling I just can tell you that you have seen 'but a taste of the terror that [Peter Jackson] will unleash'. Just one hint. Go to a BIG movie theater with a GOOD sound system and reserve the BEST seats. This piece of art does deserve nothing less.And for those complaining about missing/edited scenes - wait for the Extended Edition. Even though the movie already runs for more than three hours there is a lot potential for additional material. We haven't been disappointed before, have we, my precioussss?Nick P. (December 10th 2003, European Premiere Berlin)"
"The director was pretty jealous of the fact that a movie has to end, otherwise this movie would never have had an end. An interesting start (the first movie of the trilogy ""Fellowship of the ring"") but absolutely boring on the road to the end of it. I'm disappointed with this movie, as I've expected more of it. The characters seemed wonderful at the beginning, but the director made the worst of them. Shameful!! More shameful, as this is the movie that won the Oscar. I cannot think of the motives the Academy awarded the prize to this movie but the money that went into it. It's the second time in the history (that i know of) that the academy appreciates more the cost of a movie than the quality of it and of the actors' play. It's interesting, in this approach, that no actor in this movie won the Oscar. Why is that?"
"Mr. Jackson let us all down on this one. I sat through all three of these films before it hit me. I wasn't really enjoying them. Every dramatic moment was being thrown away because it was filmed as a close-up. Over and over again, the epic context was stripped away and all we got was big, blue eyes. People say they liked these films, but I don't think they know what they are missing. I sat there disappointed as each great moment in these stories passed by without soaring to any great emotional heights. It was flat as cardboard."
"This was not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it is in the running for the cheesiest film ever made.  A film is cheesey when the characters get all sappy and the audience isn't sucked-in due to poor character development or unbelievable circumstances.  Its my opinion that the filmmakers here depended on the audience having read the book to learn to connect with the characters, because as someone who didn't read the book, I didn't care about any of the characters, many of whom were introduced and disappeared again without really advancing the story. This film ended at least 30 minutes before the credits ran, it just seemed like Peter Jackson wanted to construct this grandiose conclusion to the epic that would please all the die-hard tolkien fans.  Save it for the two-dozen-DVD collector's edition set! This movie is crap. I want the 7 hours I gave to this trilogy back!"
"The Lord of the Rings trilogy was a huge financial success, and this one was easily the best. The battle sequences were better done than the ones in the previous two films, the characters were shown to have changed a lot since their first appearances in the Fellowship of the Ring, and it was generally a flawless film. Though it might take up half your day just watching it, I still recommend to people who haven't seen it that they watch this epic, record-breaking, breathtaking close to the Lord of the Rings trilogy! This film deserves all the Oscars it won, its place and rating on the IMDb and all the respect that it won its makers. A film to see before you die. 10/10"
"I absolutely loved this movie. After seeing the first and second movies I was already a Lord of the Rings fanatic. But this one sticks pretty close to the book, and entertains you with action while giving you important, extremely deep life lessons at the same time. Love, friendship, and fellowship all encompassed into a action packed fantasy film. For me, the third and final movie was by far the best. It finally wrapped it all up, told you the end, and gives you a satisfaction about the character's lives in the future. The other films left you hanging. I enjoyed it, and bought it, and watched it again. I highly recommend this movie."
"Without a doubt the greatest cinematic achievement in Hollywood's countless years!!!!! Everything about this movie is perfect, including the acting! Ian McKellan and Sean Astin do especially well. Of course it does help to have a director like Peter Jackson behind the camera. He shows so much skill as a director in this movie and was very deserving of the Oscar given to him. In this movie Jackson has created something so moving and brilliant that I hate for this to be the last of the trilogy. I am looking forward to more of his directing. This movie is at number 1 on my list and the first and second one follow right behind it at 2 and 3! It was deservedly given the title as best picture of 2003, and 10 other Oscars. The cinematographer was shamefully neglected and didn't receive even a nomination! ***** of *****!!!"
"A few years ago I saw The lord of the rings:The fellowship of the ring and I think it is a masterpiece.Then I saw The lord of the rings:the two towers which is better than the first one.But The lord of the rings:The return of the king is the best of the three and one of the best movies of the story of the cinema.The movie is very long,but never boring.The battle scenes are perfect.This is the best movie I have ever seen and a great masterpiece in the story of the cinema.I totally recommend this movie to everyone because movies like this deserve to be seen.Thank you Mr.Jackson for this masterpiece.Rating : 10"
The Lord of the Rings written by professor John Ronald Rule Tolkien is the greatest fantasy story on all the time. Peter Jackson with his visual effect group really went very close to what Tolkien try to show to mankind. Dark Lord is very like Hitler. I think the World War 2 influence on the Tolkien works and made him to show the future history after the war. A Habbit Bilbo Baggins find a ring from the mystery mountains . He take the ring from Gulum who killed his friend for her love (the ring) many years ago. A wizard (Gandolf the gray) find out the ring is The Dark Lord lost ring .one ring for rule them all . In my country (Iran) The Lord of the Rings is the top movie for the peoples. I saw all of three part of the Lord of the Rings and read all of them. I think The Fellowship of the Rings is better than The Two Towers and The Return of the King .But The Visual effect is improve on the Return of the King. However I offer that you see this great movie.
"When I went to see this movie, I had high expectations because I saw the other two Lord of the Rings movies and thought they were both amazing. But when I saw this movie I was in awe. This film went way beyond my expectations. There aren't enough words in the English language that could describe how good this movie is. It's just incredible!! This also marks the first time that I have ever cried in a movie theater. And I am not a person who usually cries during a movie.Out of the three Lord of the Rings movies, this one is the best by far. It is currently sitting at #4 on the top 250 here at IMDb. However, I think this movie should be #1 by a few miles. It is just so good. I can't understand how any other movie could be better. This is definitely a movie that everybody on Earth should see at some point in their lifetime. Yeah it's that good!! 10/10"
"when the second lord of the rings movie came out i didn't think that any thing could ever top this film. I was amazingly surprised when the third film came out and i was once again amazed at the talent and hard work of all of the actors and people who didn't work in front of the camera. the plots of the books are very complex and i believe that the genius that is peter Jackson and the other script writers put the films together to make sure that it was not only interesting but it was easy to understand without being patronising. I have gone on from watching the films to reading the books, the hobbit, the silmirilian and all three of the books. i found them all fabulous and especially the silmirillion, which is like the bible of middle earth and a must-read for any obsessive!! the special effects on the films were breath taking and the beauty of New Zealand has made it my dream destination in life. thanks guys!!!!"
"Potentially one of the best films of all time. The final of the three films presents a holy front, concluding both the predecessors with no remaining questions. The scale and scope were impressive to say the least and I couldn't utter a bad word about the film. Also Lord of the Rings is one of my favorite stories, because it has the ability to reach into the souls of everyone and let them become part of the journey. My five year old sister, my mother (who does have some appalling tastes), my best friend (who HATES fantasy), my female friends and my young teen sister all love the film and can connect to it. It is a story in essence about hope, and that is something everyone can relate to.I love you Peter Jackson."
"Ok just to clear something up. Despite the amazing amount of hype and numerous people saying these film were the best ever, I tried when I watched this and 1st film to watch them with an open mind neither being swayed to thinking there great because everyone else said this or the opposite. But come on, people. I have to say they appear just whizzy special effects lead extreme good versus dark (as in surroundings) ugly evil people (basically Star Wars). The storyline is tame and straighforward and the characters uninteresting. Star Wars is better and there massively overrated as well (if they removed those annoying 2 robots all together). Its basically a good film for kids with all this simplicity and straight good v evil, and I fail to see why so many adults like it so much. None of the three films deserve to be in the top100 if your like and competition of thoughtful, intelligent, well acted, important, sharply written films there. Maybe everyone just likes a straight forward situation of immense good vs terrible evil, so they know who there supporting, rather than the immensely complicated debatable thought provoking events of real life.I guess thats why the genre is called fantasy."
"The difference between art that comes out of the studio system, and art that comes out of a lifetime; if only we could develop a moving image pillar that was not driven by base profit, we might see an expression of Tolkien on ""film"" that was decent.The fall? This is the beginning of the end for our civilization; when art is so corrupted that people can no longer even tell the difference, our ""way of life"" is over; anthropologist, alien or otherwise, will mark the success of these films (and of George Bush, and of television) as the harried and quickened end of ""the West,"" not unlike the fall of Numenor...not that you would know anything about that from these ""adaptations...""What a disgrace! How dare Jackson call this Tolkien!"
"Bad acting, ok story for the fans, but I don't fancy this ""RPG trend"" crap. I don't know how this movie ever entered the TOP250 movies of IMDB.Should be ranked #500 best movie of all time or less.. My real grade for this movie is 6.0, but I voted it a 1.0 because lot's of mindless people voted it a 10, and NO WAY this boring movie is a 10.SPECIAL EFFECTS DON'T MAKE A MOVIE A 10 out of 10.Go watch the other movies on TOP10 list like Godfather and shawshank redemption and then TRY to compare it with this piece of *"
"Peter Jackson, who is talented at one thing, and one thing only, SPECTACLE, finishes his hugely successful trilogy. I'm so glad this less-than-mediocre hack was given the job of writing and directing the film adaptations of the some of the best written fantasy literature ever. The innacuracy of the story, shoddy pacing, inconsistent characterization via POORLY written dialogue, and hugely misunderstood character relationships and statuses are the largest sins committed in this film. But the problem goes deeper. This is just another in a long line of films quite nicely summed up by the word blockbuster, and quite nicely critiqued by the TRIO (may it RIP) documentary ""The Blockbuster Imperative,"" in which the course of popular culture is outlined as a quest for and to quench the thirst for EXCITEMENT rather than enrichment. Thank you Peter Jackson for shitting on the world. You are so over-rated it hurts me, and your movies will NEVER stand the test of time."
"The problem with this movie is that there's nothing new going on, its more of the same from the previous 2 movies. This is by far the weakest of the series, the ending was just so corny and predictable. Same old battles, same old Frodo, same old clichés, same old everything, this movie had nothing. This whole series could've been 1 movie, instead they just milked it for all that it was worth, and by the time this one came around i'd had more than enough. I don't understand how this movie ranks at number 4 on the top 250 list of all time, it shouldn't be in the top 1000 let alone the top 250. The only words to describe this movie are bloated and self-indulgent."
"As with the other two films in the series I wonder if the director actually read the book or just had a secretary read bits of it to him.The scenes are drawn out to ridiculously tedious lengths and bits of the plot are missed out whilst other bits are invented. And of course to appeal to the ""ER"" watching mentality a romance was invented for the film. Then to add further insult they all burst into song at the end.I don't know if these films were made chronologically but the actors do seem a bit fed up of the characters by the end. Also, our Shelob was so obviously a computer animation it made the pseudo scary build up a complete anticlimax.Tedious."
"At the slow and lingering end of this epic I was not sure anymore, whether it's the ""Lord of the rings"" or a Naked-gun styled parody of this movie itself. Shame on You, Hollywood! Before that, though, it was as good as the earlier parts. So the first two thirds I would vote as 8 or 9, but the last third as 1. Taken into account, that it was the very end of the whole epic, I felt REALLY disappointed. I don't know, do You have to be enormous Tolkien fan, in order to forget any sense of good taste at the end of this movie. I am big Tolkien fan, but maybe not that big. And for me that movie and the books by Tolkien still remain two very separate things."
"I said it before and I shall venture to say it again, Peter Jackson, thank you for making my fantasy a reality. I have never seen any film so visually stunning, a cast so immensely beautiful, nor a director as captivating. Peter Jackson is the Lord of the Cinema! Ronald would be proud to know his books have been turned into a cinematic dynasty. As a loyal reader of Tolkien for the past 15 years, I can say that these films have touched me very deeply. I can honestly say that I have never been so delighted to see the world of Middle-Earth brought to life in this manner. I have seen the animated versions of ""The Hobbit"" and ""The Lord of the Rings"" and was vehemently disappointed at both of them. However, the Peter Jackson live-action version is the only version there needs to be. To the following people: Sean Astin, Billy Boyd, Sean Bean, Viggo Mortensen, Dominic Monaghan, Miranda Otto, Brad Dourif, Sir Ian McKellen, Sir Ian Holm, Christopher Lee, Liv Tyler, Cate Blanchett, Marton Csokas, Craig Parker, Elijah Wood, Karl Urban, David Wenham, Hugo Weaving, Bernard Hill, John Noble, Andy Serkis, John Rhys-Davies, Orlando Bloom, Peter Jackson, Fran Walsh, Phillipa Boyens, The WETA team, and New Line Cinema thank you for making Middle-Earth a reality.And to the family of John Ronald Reuel Tolkien, I cannot express my gratitude enough for letting these films be made. Thank you..."
"I love this movie so much, I watch it all the time. I want to have the others also because i hope they will also be good just like this one. All the Lord of the Rings series is awesome and a good story line.I want to watch it every night 7 days a week because I can cannot get enough of this movie.This movie is the best movie I have ever watched in my life just like the others because they have a fascinating story to them and they always keep me interested in them. I want to get my friends to watch them since they are the best movies ever. I'm going to watch it when I get home from school and the store since I love Lord of the Rings."
"The only movie that comes to mind when I think of an entire cinematic experience that blew me away. The music is powerful, yet not distracting. The acting is flawless, and characters play their parts to perfection. Whoever was responsible for casting this series deserves an award. The scenery is gorgeous and the camera spends enough time focusing on it to let the viewer enjoy what they're seeing, as well as imagine they are there. The plot does not need useless side stories to drag away from the tale told by the book as so many movies these days do. Subtle humor and breathtaking visuals make this a movie worth watching over and over again. It is the only 3 hr movie I have ever seen that I can honestly say I was not bored at any point, start to finish."
"The Lord Of The Rings Trilogy, is the best movies ever...thats because the whole movie is based in a fantasy world that seems to be real, made by Tolkien...the creatures, the heroes and the content of the books can make your mind travel...as far as the Trilogy is concerned, the cast is wonderful and the actors are excellent at their roles...the costumers and the make up are wonderful...the creatures are so alive, like there are real...the special effects, the producing and the image are so good that the fantasy world of middle earth seems to be real...finally, we 've got this epic music who travels you all the time through the adventures in Middle Earth"
"To keep rating simple for my vote, let's just say that I'll give this film 9/10, but don't ask me what I'd say for what's lacking, for I wouldn't know what to say. It's a generously long film, no commercial breaks, if a person wants to call those interruptions breaks anyway, and I definitely am not qualified to criticize this film in any respect. Still, I'll give 9/10 rather than 10/10, to be conservative, say. :)People should, however, learn the basics of the story before seeing this film in order to get the most satisfaction from it. I read Tolkien's story in book form and later saw the three-part film for LOTR. So, seeing this film directed by Peter Jackson, I had no pre-study to do. One thing viewers need to know is the importance of the ring. I guess that it is the most elementary part of the story. Otherwise, people can naturally wonder what the fuss is about a ring even if it appears to be made of gold. If it's supposed to be gold, then that's not what's important about it. What is, is the magical or mystical power that it provides to whoever is wearing it and that this power is related, say, to evil. This becomes obvious in this film, but only far into it.Great film though."
"I have seen The Lord of the Rings several times. Which of the three is the best? Are the first two, only because I know that there is still much to see. J. R. R. Tolkien was a genius of literature. He had a magnificent imagination, Middle Earth is an invention of genius, where nothing was left to chance. To adapt to The movie is fantastic, Peter Jackson did a great job, where everything is perfect. To adapt to The movie is fantastic, Peter Jackson did a great job, where everything is perfect. The responsibility of Peter Jackson to make these movies was great, he was to adapt a great work of fiction for the screen, but did well."
"Absolutely incredible. The storyline is enticing and gripping. I found myself anxiously shoving in the next disk after each movie. The character development is flawless, as is the entire story. J.R.R Tolkien's dedication to these characters was properly reflected on screen. Peter Jackson did very well giving the book life on film. The casting was very appropriate, I especially loved the casting for... You know what? All of them. The love story was also an interesting touch, as I felt that it gave Aragorn an extra dimension. The feminist addition to the story was also great. All of the morals of the story I loved and admired entirely."
"I first watched the LOTR Trilogy when I was 13 y/o. It was my father's favorite movie. Back then, I was not able to understood fully what it is all about but I liked it. I did not love it like I loved Harry Potter back then, but I liked it.Entering High School, I have gotten the chance to re-watch the whole trilogy again and again and again, and this time I absolutely loved it. I became obsessed with the story. Tolkien, created a beautiful world, and wrote about this amazing characters. We see each of the characters' growth as we followed their journey up to the end.The cinematography of all movies are spot on. The sound was done beautifully and the actors gave life to one of the most-loved characters of all time.The Return of The King concludes the story of Middle-Earth, having peace back in their world. We know that CGI can both be the angel and the demon at the same time but with this film, it was done just right. This truly elevated my standard with films. The quality was spectacular and truly a timeless piece."
"No movie deserves perfect 10 out of 10 however, When a movie trilogy sticks to its main plot and does not over exaggerate the characters or their environment then it is a marvelous movie experience. All of these movies deserve about the same great rating and many thumbs up for its ingeniousness and no nonsense storyline. Most other movie series' have to make some ridiculous and over-do-it ending like in pro wrestling or like in the last matrix movie - just to keep people interested. But when a movie is made with such a wonderful story and characters and filmed with such great quality and talented actors then you have a movie this great. The LOTR trilogy sticks with its success from the first movie throughout the series, which is almost impossible to find anymore. This is a movie series that if you have not seen then you need to take the time to see them all. The only thing I dislike about these movie is the hobbits. They are just annoying to me like Jar Jar Binks in star wars but it is a necessary element to have in movies to let everyone enjoy them."
"This is an almost perfect cinematic conversion of the book. What I must stress though is that that the extended version is much better. I have no idea why New Line, by all accounts, insisted on a time limit for the theatrical releases. The extra footage adds context and gives a variation in pace that the movie really needs. Given that the core fan base often complain that the book ends too soon this was a misfire of some significance.But otherwise it is absolutely brilliant. Many people are hoping that New Line and Jackson eventually do a deal to do more of Tolkien's work. It is hard to imagine anyone else coming close to this level of realisation."
"Never having read the books but aware of how they have been revered I began the Journey tentatively with The Fellowship not fully understanding how it would impact me emotionally. I was awestruck with its strength and power to mesmerize and pull you into another world, another time. I am no stranger to ""great movies"". I have seen my share over the years. ""Godfather"" "" Star Wars"", ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" to name a few. Many different genres. Lord of The Rings stands on its own. They were superb. Having seen each of them about 20 times I can honestly state I don't have a favorite. However, the Return of the King leaves you at the end bereft and saddened. Emotionally exhausted.There will be no more. You will miss the characters who became your friends. You feel like you took the journey with them. Last February we had a LOTR day with my daughter and daughter-in-law. We watched them back to back. Extended versions. Yes, women very much enjoy the story, the characters, the music,the battle scenes, the cinematography. Each of us represents a different generation. Each enthralled by the the fantastic journey enriched by Peter Jackson's expert direction and vision. People will be watching these films forever. They are timeless. Once you visit Middle Earth you won't want to leave. You don't have to. Peter Jackson made it possible for you to visit."
"This is an extraordinary trilogy with an outstanding cast. People who are interested in action/adventure movies are bound to like Lord of the Rings. Peter Jackson has portrayed this movie in a very thrilling way. Though some parts are not included but the included parts are shown in a detailed way which enables the viewer to understand the story even if he/she has not read the book written by J.R.R. Tolkein. All the actors have acted naturally, which makes the film even more intriguing. New Zealand was perhaps the best setting for the movie because of its mountains, forests and other natural beauties which has made the movie to look even more extraordinary. Thumbs up to Lord of the Rings!"
"Now, I have been reading various comments about this film. Fortunately, most are giving this film the praise it deserves. I am not a massive Tolkien fan nor am I a massive fan of fantasy 'epic' films, but this the LOTR trilogy is simply brilliant. I fail to understand why people are afraid of CGI, yes, this film uses a lot of it, but it needs to. There is nothing wrong with CGI if it is used well which it is in this film. It is personally my favourite film, although I do not rate it higher than the Godfather or the Shawshank Redemption and others, but it completely deserves its 11 Oscars, it's 4th ranking in the top 250 and every other bit of praise or award it has received.The acting is superb throughout, the performances of Sean Astin, Ian McKellen, Bernard Hill and Dominic Monaghan really stand out but the others are brilliant too. The soundtrack for this film is by the far the best in a film ever in my opinion. Howard shore has really done a magnificent job. The film really does the book justice.10/10 - masterpiece."
"The books were amazin The films were amazin10/10 Anyone who votes for under 4 is just retarded - i expect personal opinion, but you got to see the incredible effects and filming. For example i would give titanic 5/10 - it's the most boring crap movie i have ever seen in my opinion HOWEVER it's filmed well for its time. The visual effects are impresive and the acting is good.My granma would give it higher than 5Some apply a little common sense and less stupidity (these doesn't apply to all you not totally retarted voter)"
"The Best movie in trilogy. Elijah Wood, Sean Astin, Viggo Mortensen, Orlando Bloom, Miranda Otto, Billy Boyd and above all the one and only Andy Serkis who creates Magic on the screen by playing Gollum/Smeagol, obviously with the Help of Effects Director. The direction was Excellent. The Music is Truly Masterpiece. Oscar winning movie doesn't ends over here because Extended Edition follows with great scenes of Gollum and Saruman(Christopher Lee) and Grima Wormtongue(Brad Douriff). Peter Jackson had done a VERY HARD WORK. Over all, MOVIE IS A GREAT MASTERPIECE AND EVERYONE SHOULD ENJOY THIS Oscar WINNING MOVIE ON EXTENDED EDITION. 10/10"
"The film lays some claim to being the best fantasy film ever created. It is visually and auditorily stunning. This epic adventure is of gargantuan proportions and carefully crafts a crescendo in tensions where good only triumphs over evil at the last and against overwhelming odds in the world of middle earth. The scene of one of the later battles involving the elephantine creatures provides an almost overwhelming sensory input when watched in a well set up theatre environment.The multi-dimensionality of the characters, landscape and the forces on both side creates a beautiful complexity which captures the imagination and adds to the emotional impact of the film. Masterpiece."
"Mr. Jackson has created the perfect ending to an amazing adaptation of the classic literary masterpieces. He has taken an unmanageable array of literary devices and narratives to present us with incredible visual passages, emotional journeys, and seamless blends of new technology and old-fashioned storytelling.Just like its two previous chapters, RTOK is of epic proportions. With the assistance of adept editors, the different story lines are integrated and keep us engaged for nearly 4 hours. We get to the rewarding payoff where all will be resolved.ROTK is a nearly perfect film, and some people might argue that its various endings might lessen the impact of its conclusion. It's hard to walk away from such magnificent storytelling with a simple ending. It's at least interesting to at least explore the many possibilities that such a tale might lead us to."
"The greatest film ever made without a doubt. Peter Jackson has truly brought Tolkien's imaginative and magical world to life. In my personal opinion this third and final film is better than the first and second combined. If you have watched the extended edition DVDs you will see that a great amount of care and love has been put into these films and that what makes it such an incredible film, and in my opinion, if this was made in Hollywood I would only be rating it with a six right now. If any of you reading this comment have ever been to New Zealand, you will know that it has a spectacular landscape with its snow-capped mountains and green green grass. This is why it was a perfect location for this particular film. Sadly now though the epic saga has come to end, this film will always remain in my memory as one of the few great films made outside of Hollywood."
"the fighting scenes are fantastic. Orlando bloom the best as usual. much better than the first and second films made. The film is as good as the third book. i have rated it 10/10 and all ways will. Peter is a brilliant film maker and can't wait to see more from him if they are as good as theses films. i found all the characters in the films played incredible well. all the characters in the fighting scenes were brilliant especially during the fighting scenes with Orlando's tricks with the elephant and horse and shield were really exciting adds a lot to the film. really enjoyed it and all ways will Brilliant film, great action and great story."
"I have hated Lord of the Rings from an early age. I don't know why, but I never quite liked the idea of it. But sometime I was inspired to read the books by JRR Tolkien, and immediately recognized how wonderful the story was. It was brought to life in three movies I regret to say I never saw on the big screen, only in the comfort of a home DVD. The plot line, which carries through the previous two films, is still alive and more suspenseful than ever. You cannot describe it shortly. To shorten it, in a fantasy world ""Middle-Earth"" there was a magic ring created by the Dark Lord Sauron, filled with his own power and malice. It can't be used for anything good or pure, only evil and bad, and therefore must be destroyed before it falls back into the owner's hands. If it does, he will dominate and destroy Middle-Earth. The Fellowship of the Ring must destroy it.The acting was simply magical, these people played off each other tastefully. The sets, costumes--note Eowyn's outfits and the beauty in Arwen's jewelry--and scenery, nicely set against New Zealand all were magnificent against very real special effects that give new meaning to ""bring the story to life"". Finally, the crew and cast both did a wonderful job. I must also add, the music by Howard Shore really ties everything together. It brings drama, suspense, brightness, and warmth to a movie that is both pleasing to the eyes and enjoyable for anyone to watch."
"Alas, not having read the novel, I was very excited when I saw the trilogy. A great spectacle, indeed. The great adventure-and great expectations...were all realized...But.... As I look back on it, this film is a huge achievement, but that's the problem for me. Big spectacular sfx and complicated scoring distract from the story at times. And although action and acting are carried out here on a fine story-telling scheme, I was left a bit empty. For me, the emotional trek was always not ""who is going to live or die?"", but ""how much computer power was needed?"".Fantasy films can be bit overdone and full of themselves, and I suspect that this is somewhat the case here.For real, human drama, sans all the cgi and such, see what I thought was the best film of 2003...Mystic River..."
"This is the way all books should make their way to cinema! Cudos to Lord of The Rings! It surely deserved to sweep the academy awards as it did! Outrageously wonderful trio of films! Congratulations to Peter Jackson for bringing my favorite book to life in such a splendid way! The actors were fantastic as were the set designs, costuming, cgi, and everything else. Imagine...we put a man on the moon before this epic tome was able to make it to cinema. That just shows the scope of this awesome undertaking! And what a fantastic job they did. Never in my life did I think anyone would ever be able to do justice to the books. But they did! These movies are destined to become classics. They are movies to watch over and over again..."
"I absolutely adored this film. It was so poignant and touching, even where it seemed too huge for anything as small, for instance in huge battle scenes you got shots of true friendship between the Fellowship or the sight of just one man or elf meeting their deaths brought it all down to a realistic human scale. The knowledge that, even if these characters only exist on the screen, they are there dying for what they believe in and that is a very powerful message. This film for me is like Pirates of the Caribbean. That too brings back to me how small we are on the face of everything but that that doesn't matter. Even if compared to the planet we are tiny our feelings still count. Even if you are facing a fight between you and the world you will find someone who can help you and you can do what your heart tells you to. Because if you do what your heart tells you to you won't go wrong."
"A lot of people have called this a masterpiece, and I guess so many people can't be wrong. However, this movie just did not work for me at all.When I look at the stills in the promotional books I see an incredible movie. The artwork and passion of the production crew is amazing. But unfortunately we got few opportunities to dwell on these efforts. In far too many scenes the camera was constantly moving in grand cinematic flourishes, with the effect that many of the scenes were often blurred and shaky. Worse, in the battle scenes the ""shake and bash"" camera style was used excessively. There was so much artistry in the sets and costumes, but it was spoiled by the constant camera motion and often ugly post-production. I also found the score to be incredibly intrusive, melancholy, and boring.I thought the screenplay was very clumsy, with a lot of the added dialogue feeling inferior to the original. I was particularly turned off by Jackson's attempts to increase the excitement of every scene, to the point that was going on no longer had any credibility. If the bad guys are obviously unbeatable, then there's no sense of jeopardy any more. It all starts to feel phony and unbelievable. Jackson added a lot of scenes that were just excuses to show fights or special effects. These obviously increased the excitement for many, but not for me. Although I loved some of the deviations in the first movies, this time around the plot changes felt emotionally manipulative or like excuses for more special effects.People are calling this a masterpiece, but really it's just a great original story dressed up with a lot of special effects and dumb fight scenes. Which is sad, because with the obvious passion and talent that went into these movies, they could easily have been great."
This is the best epic trilogy I've ever watched. I want to see Salmarion book of Talkin and battle with the Sauron...more about The Lord of the rings.
"This film is the climax of the Lord of the Rings Trilogy. It is a masterpiece. The dialogue is very rich. The cast is perfect. The effects are great, even over a decade later. Peter Jackson did a great job of capturing Tolkien's spiritual work. What makes this film, and trilogy, so perfect is the score. The music gets the viewers so involved emotionally. Best movie I've seen so far."
"Without giving away spoilers, I was astounded at the literary and film quality of this series. The lighting, the wardrobe, everything was just perfect for the setting of each scene. No special-effects nonsense needed.Character development and background is bar-none. The trilogy is put together in such a well-blended way. Everything complements everything else.Overall? Pure quality."
"The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King is a fantasy epic movie directed by Peter Jackson's novel from J.R.R. Tolkien. Released on December 17, 2003, The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King became one of the films that received the most criticism and was the most successful film at the box office of all time. The film earned eleven Academy Awards of eleven nominations, which later became the counterpoint of Titanic and Ben-Hur for most Academy Award winners. The film also won Best Oscar Film, making him the only fantasy film in this award-winning history. The film also became the second best- selling film in the world after Titanic, without taking into account inflation."
"This is the most exciting movie to me . each time i watch it its like the first time . everything is perfect . the actors are great the acting is great, the special effects are awesome considering that this movie was made in 2003. no one could've done it better than peter Jackson . this movie is my precious"
"The last film of a trilogy that is a masterpiece. I can only compare this experience with ""Don Quijote de la mancha"" or just Don Quijote. Itvis calm when it needs to be but when the action scenes show up they are great. The man fighting against the industrial revolution, trying to save the planet from horrible creatures that are the worst human side representation. You just don't watch this movie, you feel it."
"Lord of the Rings: Return of the King Quite simply Best one of the three, the perfect end to THE perfect trilogy. I think that this may be the greatest movie of all time. Everyone had such high expectations, and it didn't let them down. Things most likely to be seen in the Extended Edition."
"If your looking for one of the best movies (if not the best) that will take you to another world, with the biggest adventure I ever had this is the best choice. I loved this movie since I was little till now.and I doubt there will ever be made a Fantasy/Adventure movie (of this kind) so great as this.The three things that made this movie a 10/10 for me are the huge/fantastic Story, the breathtaking Filming & the never forgettable Characters."
"It was a pleasure to watch this movie. Story line-ups are awesome, graphics were amazing and the movie direction is superb. We recommend this movie to everyone. It's not just one time watch, loved it a lot! The film relates the story of the conflict which follows, and this leads to some of the most spectacular battle sequences w have seen. Again a great one to watch!"
"Lord of the Rings is so or so the best trilogy of all times, however, with The Return of the King Peter Jackson has created once more something quite special. By the especially impressive world ""middle earth"", the likable characters and the pure length of the Movie the viewer can dive unusually deeply into the movies subject."
"Dear all, I find myself watching this title over and over again with same joy as for the first time. Charisma remain still and every single scene feels right, hits the point. Thousands and thousands of popcorn pass trough my hands and will again, most probably. But this must not will be a review of only one part, yet of all three as a movie marathon can begin once again."
"I enjoy this film so much until these day. It has such intense characters and a really deep and complex story. One of my favorite all time movies. The director, Peter Jackson, is just a hero. Organization and Costume departement were unbelievably good. The whole crew was extremely motivated. I would love to be part of such an intense experience nowadays."
"The first movie of this franchise was released in 2001 and until this day i did not find any movie like the awesomeness of this movie, the effect's are much better than the effect's of the modern movies and the epic battles that motivate your body and soul and each character in it is interesting and above all this the adventure lovely adventure of the hero's of this franchise ."
"My favorite all time movie. Grew up wanting to be Legolas and have treasured that childhood thrill throughout my on screen career. The mix between the characters suit all and all can relate. In my eyes as a child I was relatable to Legolas, nowadays more like Aragorn. The only problem with this trilogy is that they have finished, the entire story has been one I have adored throughout my life."
"This was one of the most brilliant films I have ever watched. It had everything you could have asked for in a movie and more. I could watch this movie a million times, and still be in awe and shed plenty of tears. This movie helped me learn so much about so many things including myself. I would recommend this movie to anyone whether or not you have read the books or if you don't like fantasy."
"Really good movie, good cinematography has really great shots throughout the movie. The writing is phenomenal and is delivered with excellence. The plot of the movie is thorough and well explained. Overall this movie is great and a must see even if you have not read the book."
"My first IMDb review had to be for my favourite film of all time, the Return of the king, the best (imo) in the LOTR trilogy. It's one of the very few films that truly deserves the adjective 'epic'. Beautifully shot, astonishing score, amazing costumes, sets, and effects. Peter Jackson let me kiss you."
"The Fellowship of the Ring is an excellent adaptation of a story that reflects the author's world view. Fellowship, however, leaves many questions unanswered. Much of that gets ironed out as the saga continues, but families who have read the books will benefit from an even richer view of Tolkien's fantasy."
"Quite simply, I think that this may be the greatest movie of all time. Everyone had such high expectations, and it didn't let them down.  It delivered hardcore.  Give Sean Austin the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor NOW!"
"A quick note about some of the nominations that may come out from this that last film of the series.  We expect a best picture and perhaps direction nomination, but what of the acting within the picture. I must say that I felt that S. Astin turned an amazing performance in for all three pictures. It is hard for one to pick one supporting actor out of this cast that is not perhaps deserving of a nomination but I believe that his performance was steller to the character he was playing and should be picked up during the nomination process."
"About three years ago, i just hated the idea of watching this trilogy, now i love it. personally, i think, FOTR was the most interesting part of the trilogy, with its explanation of the story and background, with the introduction of the main characters, but the most touching part is this - the return of the king. i laughed (not to often, ok), i cried, and i was afraid of all the danger around our heroes. the way, tolkien described their way, was perfectly brought to screen by jackson, we are able to feel their pain, feel the little hope, the sadness. i've never been touched by a movie in that way, and i'm afraid, i will never be again.A lot of people aren't satisfied with the different endings, this movie has got, but i think, every closing has its right to be. after this journey of about 9 or even 10 hours, it's impossible to let this movie end at just one point. every step in the future live of all of them is necessary, and i enjoyed every ending as much as i felt with them during their fights and sadness.So, the journey is over, with a perfect ending. if you haven't seen this movie (and FOTR + TTT), go and see it. you haven't to be a fantasy-fan nor you have to know tolkien's story. it's a perfect movie about friendship, love, war, and about the fact, that even the brave little man can change the world!10/10"
Best one of the three... I enjoyed every minute of it! Excellent screen play... Awesome CGI!
Sheer brilliance from start to finish. The perfect end to THE perfect trilogy. Absolutely Mindblowing. Go see it.
The BEST!!!!! A perfect slot of the triologie. What a pity that it is over now. Let's wait for the Hobbit!!! Thanks Jackson!!
"Peter Jackson has managed to make the audience feeling like in another time. From the first scene till the last one, you are in the world of middle earth. I couldn´t imagine the Characters to be played by others than Elijah and Co. This movie is a real breath taker."
"I thought the movie was the best one. The graphics were awesome as well and the acting too. My fav part in the movie was the fighting part near the end when Aragorn got all the ghosts to help fight, that was really cool."
I can't believe that around December this year we won't be having any LOTR movie. I'm in denial and am convinced that Peter Jackson will make a new movie to tie up all the loose ends. They should have made this into an epic miniseries. Too many things left unsaid and undone in the Return of the King. Not that it's not a good movie -- it's the best I've seen so far.. and as the finale of the LOTR trilogy it does go with a BANG rather than a whimper that Matrix Revolutions did. LOTR die hard fans want more.... that's why we are waiting for the extended version of the video.  We need some closure...
"This movie tops off what I as a fantasy lover have always dreamed of seeing. A world class true fantasy movie.  This has to be one of the best movies I have seen in recent memory.  The plot, story line, and Peter Jacksons vision were amazing.  Again if you want to see a movie with heart, passion, determination, soul.  Then this is one that I would recommend!  A++"
"Better than the previous two and definately one of the best movies I have ever seen.  It is so good, my friends who despised the first 2 loved it. The battle scene was so exciting people in the audience were cheering as if at a sporting event."
but... in the end of the movie when the hobbits arrive to the shire in the original book they encounter to the shire ruled by Saruman.. in my opinion its a total offense to the book and their fans because the fight between the hobbits and saruman his very important to the hobbits. They leave the shire being a cowards but when return they are totally changed in the sense of warrior spirit and courage. Anyway the movie is excellent.
"I won't possibly say anything new about this movie as it's very professional, certainly best movie of the year, etc. But I want something to add - it's sure one of the best movies ever made because of love of all team to Tokein's book and material. It's something you can't describe it, because effects for example - yeah, they're great, but you have seen them before. BUT how they are done, how is acting is done, soundtrack, music, everything - it shows that many for them - for actors, artists, for all team - it was Magnum Opus. Work of Life. Made with love.Best movie ever made in fantasy genre - and best movie of the year. Oh, and certainly the best triology ever made, period."
I have watched it three times and enjoyed it more than the previous viewing this is simple a marvelous movie. The ending is just fine and don't understand why some people didn't appreciate it i think it's needed. I rate this 10/10 the trilogy will definitely be at my favorite movie collection list.
"The ending to Lord of the Rings is not only great and powerful but it will become a movie that is remembered for ages. The actors portrayed the characters perfectly,their performances are memorable and the story is unforgetable. This movie and its actors deserve a nods at the Oscars this year."
"The perfect ending of the best epic movie in the history. Do not try to compare the first, or the second movie with this, you must see it as a 10 hours movie. Sorry there is no Lord of the rings next year...DAMM!!!!!"
If you haven't seen this yet - get off of the moon and get to the cinema!!!This has to be one of the best films of all time. Minas Tirith. 'Nuff said!10/10
"... so that I can pay for another ticket and go and see it again, and again, and again... I was stunned. Literally. The film is incredible. Only someone with a psychological aversion to fantasy won't be able to see at least one thing great on the big screen when this film is runnig. Those who dismiss it as 'popcorn fair' may have a point - there certainly is a lot of spectacle up there - but you fdpn't have to read between the lines, or look deeper, because it's not the special effects or sweeping visuals that carry you along (although, that helps!) but the characters, the drama, the intensity... Sod it - I'm off to see it again. Later."
"See the movie... It rocks! It's the best of the 3 and perfectly completes the trilogy. I'll be seeing it again and again and again. After seeing it, go back and watch the extended additions of 1 and 2. Everything I saw in 1 and 2 makes total sense. Cool foreshadowing of people and events, too. I can hardly wait for the director's cut to come out!!!"
This movie was amazing!   Peter Jackson has a true vision and this entire trilogy was wonderful.  Tolkien would be extremely proud.  The only thing that bums me out now is the fact that there aren't any more to look forward to next year...  How about making The Hobbit?
"I love cinema, I love Mr. Jackson, I love Extended DVDs and I love New Line. Now that the trilogy is over, I will at last be free to actively seek a girlfriend and rediscover the many faceted social life I've been patiently ignoring for the better part of this century..."
"i sat in awe when i watched this movie.  at about 20 different times i just sat and there said ""holy f**k"".  it took words away from me.  it doesn't follow the book perfectly, but who cares?  this is what movies are supposed to be.  as a trilogy, this is the best one out there.  it edges out the original star wars in my mind because it stayed consistently good the whole way through, where as star wars didn't. this is the best movie i've ever seen"
"i saw this film straight away, and i was not disappointed. the storyline was amazing, the acting was great and the special effects were beyond amazing. this is far the best trilogy ever.your never dissapointed, it has all aspects of film genres and will win oscars big timei advise every 1 to see it, its the best ever"
"for me, the absolute best film i've ever seen.... it left me quite astounded and emotionally exhausted...the only bad thing i could say was that I WANT MORE!!!!
~is now counting down the days to the extended edition~"
"Nearly everything that has been said about this film was correct.  The visuals were amazing, the story was mostly consistant with the original plot and when small things were changed; I feel it made for a more visceral story. The only thing that's been said that wasn't right was that those who have been commenting for weeks that it was going to be ""over-rated"" or ""garbage"" were 100% WRONG. Incredible effort to make the whole thing go off like it did - thanks to PJ, the entire cast and the visuals crew at WETA. Look forward to seeing your work in Kong as well as in the Narnia series."
"This film is absolutely brilliant in many aspects.  The special effects are incredible, as are the actors who portray each of Tolkien's dynamic characters.  I went to see this film with my friend and we both found ourselves crying and laughing throughout many parts of the movie.  This is the ultimate package, bravo! I hope that it gets the credit it deserves."
"I was a little disappointed at the midnite premier here in Tromsø, Norway at the end of the movie as it didn't have the 'real' ending as JRR Tolkien had written in the book with Sarumann's and Grima Wormtounge's wrecking at the Shire, amongst other things."
"The Fellowship of the Ring was a magic movie magic when I first saw it, despite the lack of massive battle scenes, which I particuly like with the trilogy. The Two Towers did an even greater job immersing oneself into the story with the big battle of Helms Deep. The third and last movie successfully combined them both and possessed both the good story and the kick-ass battle scenes, both in much larger scale.I long to see it again. Although I rather see the extended edition cause it gives you a more complete version of the plot (including the battle of the shire)."
The only complaint I can think if is why wasn't it longer. Superbly told story with an excellent cast who clearly wanted to make this something special. If you enjoyed the other 2 films and wondered if they could finish on a high then you'll not be disappointed. My wife's comment was that it can't have been over 3 hours long because it didn't feel like it. Also managed to keep an 8 year old quiet which deserves an oscar in itself. If Peter Jackson doesn't get best picture this time then it's a joke. This film should sweep the board.
"I do not have suitable words to describe how awesome this entire movie/trilogy is! If you haven't seen it yet, do so ASAP! If you have seen it, go see it again! It's just...well, left me speechless. Thank you Peter, all the cast, the crew, and especialy Tolkien, for creating such an awesome place!"
Return of the King is hands down the best movie of 2003. Peter Jackson has created a masterpiece from the adaptation of the book by the same name. This movie will forever raise the bar for trilogy films. From the lighting of the beacons to the charge of Rohan this movie intoxicates and charms its viewers. Bravo to Newline for having the courage and Jackson for having the vision. Return of the King will talked about 20 years from now.
"After seeing ""the Return of the King"", I'm consider that ""the Lord of the Rings"" will never fade. It will be the all-time classic. Peter Jack used to be regarded as a great director after ""Heavenly Creature"". Now he has been the greatest director in the world. ""The Return of the King"" is as good as the other two. I give it 10/10."
"I can't add much to what other people have been saying; indeed, the LotR trilogy is a masterful achievement. I don't have to say that the cinematography, storytelling, acting and music are brilliant, because by now everybody knows.What is exceptionally well-done in my opinion is this: in part 1, we focus on the quest of a rather small group. In part 2, everything gets bigger and more epic... But in part 3, even though the battles to be fought are of enormous scale, instead of making everything bigger and more violent, Peter Jackson chose to highlight the characters. From the extremely subtle very first shot (a tiny worm) to the very last (won't spoil), the film treats you with memorable, highly emotional scenes of real PEOPLE. Instead of a bombastic ending you're treated with a much more suitable melancholy.
I never cried when seeing a film, until seeing this one this evening. The parts with ""I can carry you"" and ""You don't bow for anyone""... well, they're almost too beautiful. Without doubt, 10/10."
"And so it finally ends.This film is quite simply the most awesome spectacle in the history of cinema. The claim for best film, well that's for each viewer to decide. Fantasy fiction has always been very close to my heart. For me fantasy isn't an escape from reality, it's a dramatic crucible in which we can melt away the mundanity of our lives, to find that shining centre, the bare essence of our humanity. Other viewers may not hold such fantasy landscapes so dear, it's simply a question of taste, of where we are from and where we are going in our lives.If however you have enjoyed the previous two visits to Middle Earth, I can assure you that this final voyage will leave you breathless and awestruck.Peter Jackson and his creative cohorts have crafted their adaptation standing in that uneasy country, between the letter of Tolkien's words and the inescapable demands of the cinematic medium. Some of the depth of the book has been sliced away. These segments have been long discussed across the Internet, I won't detail them here.For me though, this trimming was about finding the shinning heart of Tolkien's work, not slavish and blind devotion. In a number of cases I believe that Jackson's changes have improved upon the books. If you love the book, you must learn to love the film on it's own terms, but love should come easy if your allow yourself to be swept along.I am left though with a depressing thought. Next year at this time, I won't have another excursion to Middle Earth to look forward to, only a shadow falling out of memory and time."
"Don't make the mistake to leave your seat too early (even though 200 minutes hardly qualify as too early...). The credits are simply the best I've ever seen.Seeing the characters one last time by drawing them on a bookpage-like background is a great and humble way to fade from the movies back to the books they came from.Full of sketches of no particular significance regarding the story itself, but glimpses of an universe we fell in love with.And then the One ring as the last drawing And then, the light on the movie screen goes out...
I tell you, hold your pee for a few minutes and give credits to those credits..."
"One film to rule them all,One film to define them,One film to bring them all,and in the darkness spellbind them...Too long? No, captivated every minute.Cried? Yes, the emotional effect is astonishing.Amazed? Yes, redefines ""epic"", effects are amazing, as are all the props, costumes, the lot...Done the book justice? Hopefully, bits left out, but what is there is near perfect.Worth the cost of the ticket? If every penny was worth a days hard labour.
Unsurpassable."
"This is the BEST of the trilogy, and by far the best fantasy film I have ever seen.  A must see even if you haven't seen the other two.  Now, hopefully, they will move on to the Hobbit and Silmarillion.  How can you stop such a good thing at this point?"
"This is the best movie ever made. Viggo Mortensen and Billy Boyd singing, Elijah Wood and Sean Astin with the last willpower through Mordor, Orlando Bloom, Liv Taylor and Hugo Weaving immortal, beautiful and wise, Miranda Otto and Dominic Monaghan fight together to protect the loved ones. Minas Tirith looks exactly as I imagined it to look like. And that is the astonishing part in this movie: You read the Book, you have a picture in your head and you watch the movie and it is like they put your picture on the screen. I've never seen that before with a book... If you know the book, there is always something you could criticise. But I could not think about a way of making a better movie out of this book, because it is perfect. I only miss Christopher Lee as Saruman and I miss Aragorn looking into the Palantir... The Rest of the Movie is wonderful and I do not think that there can be ever done a better movie than this..."
"Since my first reading of ""The Hobbit,"" and the LOTR Trilogy, it's been my continuing belief that Tolkien's story of Middle Earth and its inhabitants is the greatest accomplishment in the history of English literature. Now, after seeing Peter Jackson's cinematic rendering of Tolkien's literary genius, I've decided that the three LOTR flicks, taken as a whole, is the greatest accomplishment in the history of world cinema."
"I was hoping this movie would be as good as the others or better, but I was wrong. It was better then I could ever dream of. It is not often you leave the cinema with a warm fussy feeling inside. The battles, the scenery, the filming, the actors, the happiness and sorrow. The list is long of the many fantastic moments this movie share with you.If you are a Tolkien fan, you will love this movie. If you dont know what Tolkien is - you will love it anyway because it is big enough to stand on its own (given you have seen the 2 first movies).I give it 10/10 without a doubt - My expectations were skyhigh, but this time the sky had no limit!"
"It is difficult to talk about such a brilliant excellent film. The film never before has combined courage, bravery, grief, desperation and honor like RoTK. I could not understand how time passed so fast. This is the best film in the movie history. LOTR is a legend. and the legend of the film is another legend."
"I had gone into this movie ready for a great movie, but came out with an absolutely incredible movie. The movie was much more than I had expected it to be and it was just non-stop. It was so nice to see the story and have them tidy up the loose ends at the end. Thankfully it was not the train wreck of an ending that the Matrix trilogy was. These movies just kept getting better and better. Much praise should be given to Peter Jackson and all the actors for their hard work and dedication to the film. Each actor played their parts perfectly and was always very believable. Congratulations on a trilogy very well done!"
"Yes.... I have to admit.... the movie has left me speechless. This trilogy is a real masterpiece. I thought I had died and gone to heaven in that scene near the end where Aragorn faces the hobbits and says ""You bow to noone"", followed by everyone bowing to them. SUPREMO!!!!! 10/10 from me!!!!!!!"
As I watched RoTK on opening night it became clear that this was to be a film -- and trilogy -- for the ages. Those three hours may yet redefine my middle-agedness as Star Wars: A New Hope defined my teen and early adult years.My only regret is that I now sincerely doubt that in my remaining years I will ever see its equal; the bar is now *that* high.
"...this is the greatest film ever made.  No Gone With The Wind. No Citizen Kane.  No Godfather.  Nothing has transcended the medium to such a degree. Sure, you already care about the characters due to their development in the first two films, so it's at an advantage there.  But no film has provided such raw emotional power coupled with the most breathtaking visuals I've ever seen.  Brilliant."
"This movie (I'm talking about the three installments) is extraordinary, the best epic movie ever. It's true, JR Tolkien imagination is fantastic, a master piece, but just consider how many masterpieces books have been turned in a despicable pile of trash  when a director or a cast or the studio didn't know what they were doing, I bet this same story could have been a terrible disappointment with another director,or another cast. Everything in this movie went perfect. And yes people read a lot Tolkien now, but is because of this movie, 85 to 90 % of the people who said yes, this movie is good but tolkien is a genius, never picked up a tolkien book before this movie. Well the books are great but this whole cinema masterpiece is just as good as tolkien's work, in my opinion, this movie deserves a 9.9 out of 10 and that is just because I don't believe any movie deserves a 10 out of 10. Congratulations to peter jackson and all the cast, one more thing, how can movies like ""a beautiful mind"" and ""chicago"" win the oscar in 2001 and 2002 and not this great movie. I think maybe they had to wait to the last installment to give the oscar to it, otherwise they had to give the oscar to this movie three times in a row, one for every part, and that would have been unfair (the first movie winner of the oscar three times). This is not only the best production in moviemaking in a while, I'm sure it will remain in that status for various decades."
"I'm really not inclined to say ""best movie ever"" about any film, so maybe I should wait until I have more time to digest this movie. But throughout this film I was overcome by the sheer craftsmanship of it. From the production, to the acting, to the directing, to the cinematography, to the casting, to the location scouting - and in how many more categories is this film excellent?Many, many times, it could have gone sappy, been overdone, been pretentious, been slipshod, but through even the most difficult scenes the quality was kept at the highest level.And the tension is excellenlty held and drawn out. Not having read the third book, I was amazed at how many truly tense and fearful moments there were in the movie, my teeth even started chattering a few times. But then, I've done some acting myself, and when I go to a movie, I strive to keep myself as far as possible from a cynical state of mind, and I focus on letting the actors on the screen affect me how they will. Speaking of that, I cried many times during this film, and would have cried more had I been alone.If not the best movie of all time, ROTK should at least win the Best Picture award, because that one goes the the producers, and the producers of LOTR deserve such an award for having the guts and the vision to do the whole thing in one shot, and to do it up right."
"The way the scenes between Frodos and Sams rescue and the end of the crowning ceremony were done (everyone laughing, kissing and hopping around when they should be expected to be just exhausted and overwhelmed) almost destroyed the whole artwork. Thank god this was not the end of the movie. 9/10"
"You kind of have to take the movie on its own terms. It is what it is...long, confusing, battles that don't matter. On the other hand there are great characters, good acting, amazing effects, great direction (esp the spider sequences). The film just sort of is...it won't change the world, won't make sense if you have not seen the others, but it is an enjoyable way to kill an evening"
"The more time I have had to think about this movie, the more I realize that it really is a great movie.  I saw it last night for the first time and when leaving the theatre, I was not in total awe like with some movies.  After sleeping on it and working some today, I have thought more about the character development, the story and the action and I believe this is one of the best movies I have seen.  I still think FOTR is the best of the series, but Golem's character development in this movie is pure greatness. Samwise was my favorite character in this movie, Sean Astin did a marvelous job and deserves an Oscar nomination for this movie.  I was a little let down by some of the battle scenes, but know that once the extended version comes out, it will be much more clear.  Overall, Peter Jackson did a great job with all three movies and deserves more credit than could possibly be given. I am giving this movie a 10 of 10 rating, great movie.KW"
"I am saddened to learn that Sean Astin was not nomitated for Best Supporting Actor. This movie, in my opinion, was the best of the 3. Not to say the others were not good. It's just that this movie was everything I anticipated and more.Nothing I say would do this movie justice."
"Just came back from the theater, this movie is amazing. I loved the first 2, and had high expectations for this one. It's everything I wished for, and even better. The action is massive, the emotions are strong.
In a nutshell, best trilogy .. ever.11/10"
"I was so emotionally moved during many scenes that I actually wept. Me! Hard as a rock Finnish man who don't usually talk nor kiss. :)Honestly, this was _the_ best movie experience I've had so far in my life and I've seen a few during my years on this clobe.This is a MUST SEE!"
"This is one of those movies that take your thoughts away.  You can't stop thinking about it at all.  The action is unbelievable, the acting is great the special effects are beyond words.  One things I had a little reservation about was the ending, I mean it just seems little to drawn out.Tecort."
"Yes some of scenes drag out a bit too long, but just look at the detail! It is amazing.  I am not a Tolkien nut, but I really enjoyed the character development and attention to storyline.  Roll on the extended (i.e. real) version."
"Funny thing about seeing it twice in two nights was the fact that I became emotional at different parts of the movie.  Yup, tears down the face emotional.And how about Legolas and the Oliphant.  Gandalfs priceless facial expressions.Prediction: Best Movie, Best Supporting Actor (McKellan).
We all need a Samwise Gamgee in our lives."
"Unreal fighting scenes... Great dialouge, etc.. My only complaint if I had one is the last 30 minutes or so could have been shrunk to maybe 10 minutes. Other than that you don't feel like you are in a movie for 3 1/2 hours..
Now I need to watch the first 2 again.. :)9.5 of 10 stars.."
"My eyes hurt.  I don't think I blinked for about two hours.I am a notoriously tough grade when I vote on movies here, only about 15 movies have I ever given a 10 ranking to.   The first two LOTRs only ranked as 9's. This received a 10."
"...is all I can say. If I were to describe what was great about this movie, my review would be 100 pages long. This movie was the greatest movie I have ever seen in my life. I don't think anything will be able to top it. 10 out of 10."
"What a wonderful movie. There was a lot of straying from the book that I was disappointed in. But it was still an awesome film. I realize that it would be impossible for everything to be put into the film, I just feel that a bunch of loose ends were never tied up. But it still has become my favorite of the series."
"Gandalf stole the show for me. He had some of the greatest lines and did such an incredible job. Theoden also did a remarkable job. And also I thought Pippen was great as well. I'd say those were my top 3 favorite performances.""Show us the meaning of haste!"""
"I've seen the return of the king only yesterday and one thing is for sure. No other Christmas will be ever the same. I feel sad but not alone. It's like a big global community now, when we are all gathering under one ring. WE are the fellowship of the ring now.(Sorry for my English), keep on dreaming"
"...and not because you are asleep. I have already seen this movie twice now. Although I admit to being something of a Tolkien fan and perhaps even more of a movie buff, I think the best testimony I can give to this film is the quickness in which time flows while watching it. And I intend to see it at least once more before the end of the year.Peter Jackson's crowning triumph to this trilogy has elevated the mark for fantasy film making so high, that it will be decades (probably closer to a century) before it can be bested. The blood, sweat, tears, and yes, love that went into the making of this epic has reached its inevitable climax in this film.If you have any sort of emotional investment in the two films leading up to this one, you will not be disappointed. Mr. Jackson, along with the help of so many others, has crafted a masterpiece that will stand the test of time. Even after it is released on DVD's, it could be re-released in theatres every generation and capture a whole new audience.Our children and our children's children will benefit from this work of art as much or more than we will. Mr. Jackson certainly feels that way because of a certain liberty he has taken with all three films. Some filmmakers are renown for injecting themselves into their films, as Mr. Jackson did when he burped his derision at the critics during the first film. But he has taken this one step further by giving his children their own cameos in all of the films (they are noticeably older in this one). Only an artist supremely confident in his skill and the skill of his aides would do this. I think they will grow to be proud of their father's acheivement and appreciate that they have been immortalized in so special a way."
"Is the best movie in the world, it's wonderfull, beautifull, perfect... everything it's amazing. There is not mistake to me. You have to see this movie. Everithing it's perfect. There's no words to can discribe what are you belive in that moment because you can't belive it. The best in the movie it's Orlando Bloom, Viggo Mortensen and there's also Elijah Wood, but don't forget then that it's for the ladies... and for the gentleman... Lyv Tyler and Cate Blanchett.And remember if you are not see this movie ... you have to see it!!!"
Definitely one of the greatest cinematic achievements ever.  Return of the king is one of the greatest movies ever made.  The LOTR Trilogy is the arguably the greatest trilogy of all time and i hate to say it because im a star wars fan.  But I have never seen a Trilogy so beautifully made in my life time.Long live the KING!
"i was a little bit critical before the beginning of the movie... i totally loved the the book of j.r.r. Tolkien(read it twice) The two towers, was a little bit disapointed in my opinion., but this part was TOTALLY great... Best part of the trilogy!! and that is something VERY special... U all know, mostly part 2 or even 3 are much worse, than the original.. but this time... wow, sometimes it was really breath taking (and that really happens very rarely for me)....    i don't want to hype this movie... because if u expect to much of a movie.. it always disappoints you. But for me, clearly 10 out of 10, even better than kill bill(and that's worth something imo)"
"Peter Jackson and his teams of gifted actors, designers and special effects wizards deliver what can only be described as one of if not the greatest epic of our time. And it should be noted that he does not wimp out at the end, but gives the most extraordinary and pleasing conclusion. This entire saga, which now feels like one film, rivals Star Wars as the greatest trilogy in the history of film.
Mr. Jackson - Good Job & Thank You from all of the fans."
"The movie is great, Storyline perfect, Special Affect as well. Actors did their best all is good, but they cutted little too much and now the Storyline moves too fast  - cutedthe battle with Saruman, and many other things.If I think about it, and if I would have home cinema system I would definatly wait for the EE or SE DVD cause w/out those stuff it spoils the whole movie.. perhaps not much but still."
"LORT3 was very graphic for a PG-13. There is catapulted severed heads, Dragon-like animals decapitated with blood, and a blood depiction of fingers being bit off. This one was definatly the goriest out of all the LOTR films."
The greatest of the three Lord of the Rings movies and one that will blow your mind. It shows how much hard work went into this trilogy and it shows. I cannot give any higher praise. As a filmmaker i know that Peter Jackson and his team did something no one else ever has and probably wont for a long time to come. Its THE trilogy to end all trilogies. Superb filmmaking. A+
"Brilliant!There are no words to discribe this movie. It is a perfect combination of pure Action ,Drama, Adventure and Fantasy. I recommend you all to see the all 3 movies one after another to max' your enjoyment from the outstanding performance. A truly MUST SEE MOVIE!!!!!"
"Why God? Why, oh why is the journey over!?I have got to pull myself together.Its just a movie. Its just a really good movie. Its just an incredibly superior film.  Its just one of the greatest motion pictures of the last hundred years.  Its just one of the most wonderful story ever conjured up by the human race.Yeah, its not that big a deal."
"A perfect finale to a perfect trilogy. Perhaps one that will never be matched. This is a magical film of rare beauty; stunningly photographed, wonderfully acted and lovingly crafted. I can't believe Tolkien would not have been touched by such a fantastic tribute. If Peter Jackson doesn't win an Oscar for this then those responsible ought to live forever in shame. In fact they ought to invent a Nobel prize for Film and award it to him in perpetuity. A wonderful achievement - I'm itching to get back to the cinema to experience it all again. This is a cinematic event - you'd be crazy to miss it."
"The real competition for Lord of the Rings is not, say, Harry Potter or even Titanic or Gone with the Wind, but the great epic films of the likes of Kurosawa or Eisenstein. It is in fact Eisenstein who I keep coming back to in trying to think of someone who so completely envisioned the epic on such a grand scale that had never been seen before. This is, by far, the best of the three Ring movies and it lets you know just how much better it is going to be in its very first scenes as Smeagol first encounters the ring in his own hobbit past. There will no doubt be all the award nominations for best film, best direction & everything technical under the sun, but the two actors who really deserve nominations for this film are Sean Astin & Andy Serkis."
"There are a very few films that have the ability to captivate and utterly involve you in them in such a way that allows you to forget about anything else except what is occuring on screen.  Rarely in my life, and certainly not frequently in my adult life, have I been completely swept away by such an immersive and brilliant tellling of a tale as the Lord of the Rings trilogy has been so able to do.  But with the release of the final chapter in the series here, this stunning series comes full circle, and I am left feeling more satisfied leaving a theater than I have ever before in my life! I know that everyone want's to know how good Return of the King is, but I don't want to limit my vision to this one amazing film because it doesn't do it justice to limit my perception to the final chapter without including the two previous brilliant works in the series.  I feel that Return of the King takes the glorious foundation and inner structure that Fellowship and Two Towers had laid out and builds the most epic film series of all time! The truest, greatest realization of an absolutely moving literary masterpiece!"
"Peter Jackson and his crew. And I'm not joking about it either. This trilogy leaves The Matrix in the shadows. Even more so when you look at the extras on the dvd's. Where the interviews on the Matrix dvd don't go any further than ""wow"", ""fantastic"" etc., the people on the LOTR dvd's do have something to say about the process of filming, the depth of the story etc."
"Many people ask me to identify my ""favorite movie,"" or the ""best movie"" I've ever seen.  I deflect such questions, because too many factors and subjective judgements affect and periodically change my answers to them. However, I will state unambiguously that ""The Return of the King"" is the most spectacular movie I have ever seen.  Best? Favorite? I wouldn't say. But certainly the most spectacular.  Wow!"
"I had been anticipating the premiere of this movie for almost a year and after seeing it, I never expected it to live up to all of the hype. I was sadly mistaken. The Return of the King is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time and definitely the best of the trilogy. The special effects were incredible, the acting was brilliant, and it was by far Peter Jackson's best work. See this movie as soon as possible!!!"
"In my opinion, this one was the best of the trilogy. The battle sequences were beautiful, the special effects were beautiful, the acting was great,...The movie starts with Sméagol killing his own brother, Déagol, who found The Ring in a pond. Sméagol is desperate to get that Ring, and he strangles his brother. And then the story begins. From beginning to end, this movie stays exciting and beautiful. To me, the battle sequence in Minas Tirith is one of the most beautiful scenes ever filmed. Peter Jackson proves again that he is a great director, and the cast prove they are great actors. The Nazgul are really scary, every scene is filmed superbly, in short, this movie is dazzling! 10/10"
"Brilliance! Thats all I have to say about Tolkiens fabulous imagination and Peter Jacksons amazing way of bringing it to life and film! This movie made me cry, laugh, and kept me on the edge of my seat in suspense. This is by far the best movie I have, and probably ever will see in my lifetime!
It deserves every bit of a 10 :) if not more..."
"A truly stunning movie to finish the trilogy.  The Return of the King has surpassed the effort in the previous two movies.  The story was told with perfect pace, the action sequences left you breathless with heart pounding, the emotions drew you in, the screech of the Fell beasts scared the living daylights out of you.It is obvious that immense love and passion has been liberally poured into the making of these movies and the result is most evident in the Return of the King.History will mark this movie as one of the greatest ever!"
"There are many things changed from the book, many things missing or shortened. You will miss some really interesting parts here and you will discover others have been changed. Some of the special effects are really badly done. The makeup have some flaws and the hobbits look sometimes really fake. Sometimes you can notice there are small kids dressed like the main characters... The good thing is that...you don't care about the changes in the story, the bad FXs, the kids in costume, or the 3:15 hours of reel. The movie is so amazing, so perfectly well crafted that you forget about any possible flaw and you just dedicate to admire the incredible explosion of images, sensations, colors, sounds, and lessons of good cinema narrative you are living right there. Cause is a movie you live, not just see. Peter Jackson shows again and for good he knows to tell a story, a complicated and long one, with art and taste. Dedication and respect for the viewer, this movie delivers in every aspect, in every frame. You will be wishing for more after the movie have finished, and you will forget the little flaws but to remember forever the experience of the best trilogy ever made."
"To say that this movie is the greatest movie of all time is an understatement. This movie was so unbelievably awesome, that every movie i see from now on can't even compare. You have to see this movie!"
"I'm normaly an extremly articulate person, but this films brillance- all three of these films as one entity in my mind now, leaves me speachless.
Only small imperfections bothered me, the audience bothered me more then anything in the movie could imagine bothering me. Aragorn, wasn't as prominent and proud as he was previously- but he was still a king."
Excellent. Best of the best. I sat sweating through the whole thing. Emotionally draining. I will see it again.
"I have never seen a movie quite like this, I was not bored once during the entire movie and that is 3 hours and 20 minutes.  I don't think I've ever been moved as much as I was at the end of this movie.  Once the credits came at the end it felt like the perfect ending, Jackson did not screw this trilogy up a bit and I thank him for making three of the best movies of all time.  10 out of 10 I say."
"This movie is great, I just came from seen it and I wanted to comment on how brilliant it is. Visually it is stunning I mean the special effects are really breathtaking and combined with the great music, it makes it scenes really brilliant. I mean the music adds emotion to the scenes. The story is great, the acting is good, the special effects are extraordinary. It also has a motivating story, its good vs evil and well there are lots of things that inspires you. I left the theater with emotion and a good feeling. Not any movie makes me feel that way. It is extraordinary."
"In all my years I have never experienced anything quite like the LOTR Saga. I am not even interested in Wizards and Hobbits and Evil Monsters. But I love LOTR movies and I love ROTK the best. This movie tops all others due to its intense screenplay, amazing writing and directing, and superb special effects. The acting is outstanding as well. Anyone who might think this move is a little childish for them, like I did, you owe it to yourself to see this film."
"I'll keep this simple:'The Return of the King' perfectly completes what is the single greatest cinematic achievement in the history of film. Never again will audiences be this captivated and emotionally invested in a journey so rich and beautiful.Sure, cinema will never lose it's power and will continue to enthrall us until the end of time. But it will never burn as bright as this."
"This film failed to convey the emotions and depth that sprung forth so effortlessly from the pages of Tolkien.  Did anyone who saw this movie feel sad at the end?  Or at any point in the movie?  Or anxiety, or pity, or relief?  Personally, I felt more emotionally invested in the hobbit cartoon. The detail and effects are amazing -- but I think he may have missed the forest for the ents."
"This is the best of the trilogy. Started with calm story of Smeagol, followed by long huge battle and ended with the serenity of the Shire. The plot just awesome! The best part is when Merry/Pippin singing to the Manager of the throne at Minas Tirith. certainly i will watch it again soon."
"The Lord of the Rings, The Return of the King is the best film ever.You must watch this movie if you want to know what a good movie is, and if you want to enjoy a movie the most.I enjoyed it the most in my life. It has everything, love, war, peace, and most important: a good ending!Excellent!"
"Nothing is perfect, but this movie was as perfect as it gets for me. I've never had such high expectations for a movie, but this movie met or exceeded them all. There are some changes from the books, but they make sense and are few. Completely enjoyable."
"I couldn't do this justice, so I'm not going to try ;-)I have to write four lines, otherwise the site won't accept the review.  So here they are ...Believe What Everyone Says"
"The movie was spectacular.  For the most part, it was pretty accurate to the book.  The parts that weren't from the book added to make it more understandable.  The acting was great, action was great, music was great. I really felt connected to the characters and by the end was emotionally exhausted.  What a movie!  I will see it again and again."
"Without a doubt, this movie has to be the best film achievement of the year. All elements of filmmaking deserve recognition; production, acting, directing, visual effects, sound, music, special effects, cinematography, everything.  It had it all.   I cannot wait until the extended edition dvd is available for my collection.  What a treat not only for all middle-earth followers but for lovers of good cinema worldwide."
"The past few years have produced ridiculous sequels like The Matrix, OnceUpon a Time in Mexico, Dumb and Dumberer and so on to once great films. AndLOTR is a wonderful relief from the numbing crap to come to theaters. In a word, The Return of The King is amazing. It delivered more than anyone had expected and was a spectacular ending to a flawless series. Diving into the specificswould only leave me wondering what I left out. It definetly raised the bar, maybe incomparibly high, to filmmaking but never lost sight of it's accuracy to the books.Almost never have I found the $6.00 I spent at the movies so valuable.I say almost because I saw the first two LOTR."
"The movie-seeing world is divided in those who've seen the Return of the King and those who are about to see it. A real masterpiece. I can only use superlatives to describe how breathtaking and magnificent this movie is. If you haven't seen RotK, get off your lazy butt and hurry to your nearby cinema."
"Must admit that Part 3 did not disappoint me at all. Actually I think it was better than the 2 others even though it is difficult to compare them.Though some things are missing in the movie compared to the book, PJ has accomplished to have the most essential parts within this masterpiece.I look forward to see the extended version where Fraramirs love to Eowin is shown.What a great movie, a must see !!"
"This is the single best movie I have ever seen. I give it 2 thumbs and 2 big toes up! I can't wait until the extended edition comes out and I'll just sit on my butt and watch all 3 extended editions back to back. The only thing that I have to say to Peter Jackson is, ""PLEASE MAKE THE HOBBIT!"" I want to see the battle of five armies."
"Don't believe the reviews of the slow ending, etc.  It was nearly perfect! 'Hollywood' reviewers expect a Hollywood ending, but Peter Jackson is not from Hollywood.  Kudos to him and his staff for doing it right. Another note, 3 1/2 hours was not enough.  It should have went closer to 4 hours.  I hope they have an extended edition dvd!"
"With so much Hollywood trash coming out on a weekly basis, I have come to dread going to the movies.  I used to go every week and now its not even once a month.  This movie proves, what without a doubt, what good film is.  With so many other filmmakers ruining their films by giving in to the temptation of heavy special effects and little story (*cough* Matrix Revolutions); I am glad to see there is at least one filmmaker left who knows how to create a masterpiece in this day of age.
I consider my self pretty critical when it comes to film.  There are very few movies that I would ever consider giving a perfect 10.  But I would have to say this is one of them. Now that I have seen what film can be, I feel I have raised the bar and will find it difficult to enjoy anything new to come.IÕm not going to get into all the elements that made this great, I donÕt feel like writing something that long.  But all I can say is that if Peter Jackson, and the rest of his brilliant team, does not get an Oscar for this, something is very wrong- but then again, I stopped watching the Oscars years ago."
"What can I say? This is the best movie EVER. Watching it only reminds me why I decided to go into filmmaking. I mean, I'm so jealous of everyone who was able to participate in the making of the trilogy. There is nothing I wouldn't give to have been able to be a part of this masterpiece. I know that one day, you all will be seeing my name on works of art such as this one. I was moved, drawn in, my heart raced, I mean, almost every emotion within me was experienced while watching the movie. There is little more that I can say about this movie. It was just amazing...breathe takeing...REALLY DAMN GOOD. It will put up stiff competition for the OSCAR for best picture this year. That's all I can say. WOW!"
"This is one of the best movies ever.  I gave it a 10.  Absolute must-see!!! It was a good end to the trilogy, and let you know what really happened at the end, instead of having one of those lame endings where you are left not knowing what really happened.  It answered all the questions that you had in your head about the film."
"This is, without a doubt, the best movie I have ever seen.  It is so different from most movies today, in that, it actually has some virtue in it!  This story teaches what it means to be noble, good, and true.  I just loved it and already want to see it again!"
"A truly amazing movie with incredible scale; more packed with plot and action than the first two movies combined.  The movie took some liberties with the plot from the book, but must be considered as a separate entity, and is a masterpiece in its own right.  A little drawn out at the end as well, but, overall, one of the best movies of all time."
"I was in geek heaven the whole time. The script is delightful, feeling and full of wonder. The acting is superior to the first two movies. The cast has gelled wonderfully. Jackson is the first director to properly shoot three movies at once, and with good success and he will live in history for doing so. I can't say anything bad about this movie. 100/10 for being 10x my expectations."
"This film rocks. Big time. Oh, yeah, sure there are some editing problems (where stuff was cut away to keep the running time of the theatrical release somewhat under control) but 99% of the film just plainly delivers. In spades. Come on guys, if you don't like this one, you probably don't like the movies."
"Hello everyone,Well ROTK was astounding (of course).  However I am amazed at the number of comments, reviews, and statements about the film from people who have not read the books before hand.  Listen up people, You cannot fully appreciate this film if you have not read the books! Its impossible!So please, don't go stand here and go on about how long it was, and how it made to many strong statements about christanity, and other plot complexities that you cannot possibly understand.  If you are planning on seeing these movies, I emplore you to read the books before hand.  It gives you an appreaction for the art that Peter Jackson has created, and an understanding of the motavation of the characters.  Honestly, if everyone who has given this movie a poor review had read the books, they'd be on the ground praising Jackson as the cinematic visionary that he is."
"I thought the ending perfectly captures the spirit of Tolkien's greatest work - it brought tears to many in the theater where I was sitting. What a way to end probably the most enduring of modern film classics and epics.The battle scenes were incredible to say the least - what else can I say that have not been said by others!For good measure, I brought a buddy who had not watch any movie for years and by the end, he said he's got to watch parts 1 & 2 and 3 (again) - that's how good ROTK was.A movie to end all movies."
"I knew going into the movie that many people, myself included, would leave feeling very torn.  On the one hand, you've just left one of the most masterful films in history (you have to be pretty pumped about what you've seen for the past 3:20), and on the other you know that what started exactly two years ago and has been the ""can't believe I have to wait a year for another fix"" time marker of most moviegoers is OVER!  Having said all that... WOW, what a satisfying movie experience.  Other than the crappy sound problems in my theater, I can't think of one thing I'd change.  I'm sure I'll rethink that once I see the extended DVDs next year!  Don't care about any of the shifting or omissions PJ had to do...all of it worked!"
This movie is the very best out of the trilogy. The CGI is amazing and the action scenes great to watch. Even though the movie is most 4 hours you won't notice it.A few places of bad dialog does not diminish this movie at all. Some inconsitancies in the plot fail to bring the movie down. It is truely the best movie of 2003. It makes up for the dismal Matrix Revolutions. Still upset about that one.
"An excellent conclusion to an excellent trilogy, as good as i expected it to be. I found that the last 30 mins of the film dragged out a bit, maybe the film could have been a tad shorter. I might have only found it a bit long due to the hour I watched the film, the midnite showing.. Maybe watching it at a more sane hour will make it more manageable ;P Still, excellent film."
"The final journey of the 3 picture epic does not disappoint. Purists might complain of some missing content and changes... but that's a moot point by now. There was a little more time between scene switches this time, which did make it easier for some to follow probably.I felt that they way all the ends stories/plots were tied up was awesome. There were plenty of emotional up-down-up-down moments like strikes in a kick-boxing ring.I honestly can't say much else. I was blown away yet again. I only have a few ""issues"", but nothing that could possibly lower my 10/10 rating for this.One question I wonder... was the first fly-by to Edoras intentionally played in reverse for effect? Or because the scene looked better that way? I'm sure the answer is about the effect.. I'm just not sure what PJ was going for.Now to await my second theatrical viewing of it with the family and the extended DVD release."
"The best way to sum up the impact and quality of this movie?  It was everything that the Matrix trilogy wanted to be and couldn't.  In deed, this trilogy will likely eclipse the original Star Wars films as the greatest film trilogy of all time.  It strikes me as one that will be timeless, appealing to generations of film lovers.TRotK is a masterwork in every sense, bringing the series to a triumphant, breathtaking conclusion.  It continues the pace of growing ever larger, while simultaneously becoming more intimate in terms of character growth. It is, in short, the perfect visual realization of JRR Tolkien's vision.Congratulations to the new king of moviedom, Peter Jackson, and the wonderful actors that breathed life into the biggest cinema gamble of all time."
"I am going to keep this short and sweet. As per the now common LOTR receipt we have exotic shots, sweeping battle scenes, fabulous acting and wonderous special effects. Never the less this film never ends! Just when you think it has ended and you feel satisfied the screen fades to black and we're back at ""the shire"" once again. Peter Jackson is an excellent director but why do have to see a useless plot point such as Sam's home and family when all of Christopher Lee's scenes, including an elaborate death scene, are left on the cutting room floor? Jackson claimed the choice was a simple matter of viewing time. Yes the film is too long and needed to be trimmed down. sadly it would seem they made all the wrong cuts which puts a severe hampering on this final installment in the trilogy."
"This is as good as I imagined it could someday be when I read the books many years ago.  Perfect casting, fantastic directing, etc. I want to have a friend like Sam. Loose ends wrapped up, all things as they should be. Quite the achievement and terrific entertainment."
"When I stepped in the movies I was scared that the last lord of the rings movies might not live upto its words. I was absolutely wrong. It was just simply wonderful. This was definately the best out of all 3, I clearly state with no hesitaion Lord of the Rings is the best sequel ever! GO WATCH IT!"
I check ratings here for movies i would like to rent or sometimes when i want to see a movie with my wife. the only reason i registered is to say that this movie is simply AMAZING. there are many movies that are good but LOR 3 is awesome!
"Exquisite, breathtaking film making, loved every frame of it.Peter Jackson has now officially earned a place in history as the mastermind behind The Greatest Trilogy Ever Made(tm), and considered as a whole, the first true cinematic masterpiece of the 21st Century. Ranks alongside the very best cinema of the last 100 years, and will be talked about and revisited for that many years to come.Of course it will probably be robbed at the Oscars, but that's OK - history will be the judge and history will be kinder. Perfection."
"WOW! The Lord of the Rings Trilogy is amazing. Return of the King was an excellent film.  Sure, it wasn't straight from the book, but hey, it's a movie, not a book. It was perfect. I was so pleased with the way that Peter Jackson portrayed the film. I had heard that he had a sign in his office saying to the effect, that ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy would beat Star Wars, guess what, it did."
"Okay, I read the books, and I knew what was going to happen, but I still couldn't stop crying. I guess just seeing people act it out makes all the more wonderful. I loved this movie, and I think Peter Jackson did the books justice. For once I've seen a movie based on a book that I can be extremely happy about. Kudos to you Peter Jackson."
"It's awesome. To those of you who haven't seen it on the first day yet, it's awesome. That's all I need to say.Well, maybe I would have liked to see Gandalf blow up something, but just for fun, not as part of the film.Wow."
"The only thing that must be said is :Thank you, Peter Jackson!You're the Greatest....A Special Achievement Award must be created to honor all the people involved in the creation of this Masterpiece of Cinema! For the moment, honor them by seeing this RETURN OF THE KING over and over again in theaters..."
"i can't say enough about how amazing this movie is. the cgi is great, the action is intense and it is the best conclusion to any trilogy ever!i'm just sad now that i can't look forward to seeing another LOTR next year."
The film was great! Amazing battles and fantastic filmed.... The only thing is the ending... it's a bit long... Instead of one happy ending it had seven. But everything else was great. I'm looking forward to see the extended version! Still one of the best films ever!
"The epic film that wowed the world and took over our imaginations in 2001, 2002 and now in 2003 has finally drawn to a close. Will the world ever be the same again?The action scenes are epic, yet the main focus is still on the relationships of the characters, a trait that is little seen in the special effects driven films of recent. The end will have tears in your eyes, but leaves you satisfied and upbeat.A totally astounding film, Peter Jackson and the cast and crew deserves a big thanks from the world for treating a much loved book with the kindness and affection it deserves and for bringing it to life in such a beautiful and amazing way.Is it the best film ever? Of course."
"The Return of the King was everything I hoped for and more. The action and drama are woven together in a beautiful, heart-stirring way. I was deeply moved by the time the final scene faded away. Thank you, Peter Jackson, for bringing the heart and soul of J.R.R Tolkien's world to life for this generation and all to come."
"For those who want it all: action, adventure, romance, great battle sequences, eye-opening special effects, etc. here is a very rich story worth seeing for anybody who can have the patience to sit for 3:20 in a movie theatre. Not that the movie gets boring at any time, just that 3:20 is an awfully long time.The worst part of the movie is the ending, where you realize that it is finally over. There is nothing to look forward to now, just the Extended DVD. It used to be infuriating not to know what happened next, but people just don't know what they have until they don't.The movie is very well adapted. All the storylines presented in the previous movies are given closure (except for Saruman's maybe). It is not perfectly accurate to the book, but no matter. The movie is great!"
"I went to the midnight showing.  Despite being exhausted as I dealt with ninety 5th graders the following morning, I couldn't help but think that I was a part of something.  Despite the ending, which I felt dragged a bit, the overall movie was a masterpiece.  The trilogy was fantastic and I can't wait to watch all three in succession, but each movie stands on its own as a great story.  Let's hope that Peter Jackson gets a crack at one of the Harry Potters.  As for the ""Star Wars"" comment, I love those movies.  But I will introduce my children to Tolkien and Jackson, in that order, as great books translated into great movies stand the test of time."
"A visually stunning cinematic masterpiece. Having been a big fan of the series, I was pretty skeptical of an attempt to bring them to the silver screen. The first two films were very good, the extra scenes on the DVD make them excellent. The third movie is head & shoulders above the previous two. The scenery is visually stunning and is everything I hoped I would see. Andy Serkis as Gollum is excellent. I would hugely recommend it."
"I laughed, I cried, I never wanted it to end.After spending what might have been the last 30 minutes of the film nearly racked with sobs, sitting through the entire final credit sequence, and wondering what I was supposed to do next, I decided I had to leave the pages of the book that I just saw and face the world again. It was not easy.There are many scenes in this film that I forgot to breath. I remember exhaling on more than one occasion, as I was held breathless by the images that I had witnessed.I'll tell you something though...nothing is perfect. There were some scenes which I felt were actually lacking (in my desires for things to be ""by the book"") in places. I thought it started slow, and the opening sequence, while good, felt out of place. It needed to be somewhere, I'm just not sure where. In the battle with Shelob, I never felt what it was to be faced with that light, as she was. Or to have felt the Sting. However, just how do you convey the emotion of a giant ancient spider?I don't care. It's the Best Picture. The Best Trilogy. A Towering Achievement. Can anything else done on screen compare, in our lifetimes? I wish I could have been lucky enough to be more than just a part of the audience."
"So we come to it at last, the end of the great trilogy of our age.Our parents had Star Wars.They had The Godfather.They had Indiana Jones.We have The Lord of the Rings.And what a wonderful trilogy to have.Many people will not like The Lord of the Rings and they will have their reasons however irritating or ignorant they may seem to fans but nothing is without reason so don't pester them. Now I suppose I should talk about the movie.Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King.What a Movie. WOW. I don't fancy myself a film critic so I am going to do this like a fan, like it should be. This movie is action yes, but its beyond that. Its at least five diffrent stories which meet at the end. Five stories which are no greater then any other. Without each piece there would be no success and so no one is more important in the end.I don't seek out meaning in a movie I intend to enjoy. I watch it, enjoy it and then go back to find out what I missed the first time. and I tell you after three and one half hour I have no doubts I have missed ALOT. There is just too much to absorb in one sitting. You have to go back and revisit Middle Earth again. Maybe Again? It won't really matter, I love it vastely too much to say ""Meh..saw it, it was good but I will wait for it to come out on video."" Its just too much. Too much to ever put into a review and have it mean anything. Atleast for me.I have it 9 stars. There is always room for improvement but so far as I am concerned it has well earned a 9 star rating.So go and enjoy the end of the journey. Its nothing short of Satisfying. You can leave the theatre, take a breath and accept it. The journey is over and by god what a journey it was.So Thank You Peter Jackson. If you win awards for this movie or not your still a hell of a director with a hell of a cast and ONE HELL of a team which made this Middle Earth a reality."
This movie was simply amazing.  Definitely the best of the three.  Hats off to Peter Jackson.  I do not believe that anyone will be let down (ie... Matrix) in the last installment of this epic trilogy.I would like to know why some parts of the book were left out. Particularly when the hobits go back to the Shire.
"I just came out of the cinema. This is a worthy ending to what must be the most stunning series ever produced. Chapeau Peter Jackson and crew, I think it's about time the Godfather moves over a place. Enjoy !"
"I don't think it's necessary to go into great detail why this film is so fabulous.  I just want to say if you haven't seen this trilogy yet, get off whatever mind-numbing drug you're on and GO SEE IT.  Some people (who have not yet seen it) tell me that they're not ""fantasy buffs"" but I don't think that matters.  This is real drama and if a film tells a wonderful and thankfully now complete story, the genre is not important.10 out of 10"
"Wow!!! If you've never seen a LOTR movie before, go rent the first two JUST FOR THIS ONE! Everything was incredible, and it is flawless. As for the endings, beautiful, touching, and potent stuff on film. Just stop reading and go see it, then go see it AGAIN!!"
"Peter Jackson's epic ends in grand fashion. Without a doubt the largest and best fight scene I have seen in a movie. Great mixture of adventure, epic battles and comedy. Me, my wife and daughter were all awaiting the movie and were not disappointed. Hopefully Mr. Jackson will finally be awarded the Oscar for Best Director and LOTRs will be given it's due for best picture. Sean Astin is also much deserving for a Best Supporting Actor nod as well. It leaves only one question....what the heck am I gonna want to see so bad next Christmas!!! Congrats Peter!!"
"Emotionally charged tour de force - Truly Tremendous Trilogy - Roller coaster of action-packed eye candy - Picture of motion that surpasses belief....the last truly great movie of our time?No matter what any of us say about Return Of The King and it's two preceding chapters, the truth of the matter is that no movie trilogy has ever come in such a complete package and told such a complete story. This is because of the way the films were shot and the story being widely acknowledged as one of the greatest ever told.People are allowed to criticise and pick fault - everyone has there own opinion. Those who miss the obvious and are blind to the love and devotion that seeps from the celluloid at every turn of the glorious plot, I pity.Not one line of cheese is uttered - the performances make even the elvish hyperbole acceptable, so even from depths despair to great joy every line seems real.Yes the book's been changed and there are significant cuts but the spirit remains and that's the point. It's been a long time in coming but we now have the greatest movie trilogy of all time to watch when we have read the greatest of all tales ever told!"
"So, we have come to it at last. The end. And what an ending. I could hardly breath during some of the greatest battle scenes. Battle scenes I up until now, only imagined. Peter Jackson and his crew has in my opinion, created one of the greatest films and film trilogies of our time. The richness in the visual presentation as well as in the details and development of the characters, makes this an overwhelming experience. The only flaw in my opinion was that it was too short, with it's 3 hours and 20 minutes! I look forward to the extended version next year."
"This is the most perfect movie I think I've ever seen.  It was visually stunning, the plot was amazing, and best of all, it was completely acceptable by Tolkien fanatic standards.  It's the kind of movie that, cliche as it sounds, will make you clap and cheer from your seat. Obviously there were things that were omitted from the text, but those things were chosen carefully, and did not detract from the greatness of the film.  I loved this movie, and I am absolutely dying to see it again."
"After the bitter disappointment of the Matrix trilogy, I entered the cinema with doubt, hoping that this ending to the trilogy wouldn't disappoint.It doesn't. It's an epic!Peter Jackson gives us a concluding chapter that is perfectly shot, with excellent dialogue keeping the audience captivated for the duration of this long movie. The battle sequences are incredible, surprising and just as good as what you could hope for.Yes there are a couple of ""cheesy"" moments but these can be forgiven as the rest of the movie leaves you spellbound. I read the books about 18 years ago and had forgotten most of the details of the story, so I'm not sure what the purists think, but hey as a film, well it rocks!Expect it to be in the Top 10 for some time to come, simply legendary!"
"I just got out of the final LOTR movie and I am still in awe!!!!  I didn't think that it could get better, and I must admit that i was worried it wouldn't live up to its hype...but I WAS SO WRONG!!!  Everything about it is wonderful and I can't wait until I can go and see it again :-)"
"I was really hoping that they could make the last movie a worthy ending. And they really succeeded. It might differ a bit from the book, but I think that really was all for the better. This is a brilliant movie and an fantastic ending to the trilogy. Well done to all who were involved in making it.All the scene's are fantastic in every way, from the battle scene's to ceremonies, it's overpowering. When you finally step out of the cinema you'll be realizing your back in reality."
"Best of the three ... hats off to Peter Jackson.One of the most perfect films that I have ever seen, except for a cheesey bit near the end, it cannot be faulted.I just cannot wait till the Extended version is out, I want to watch all three in one sitting to get the full effect of the trilogy."
"Just a note to film watchers, especially to fans of the book. This movie, along with all the other LoTR theatre movies, is not the finished item. Jackson knows what works well in box office terms and has crafted the cinema release of this film for the average cinema goer. The completed film that is designed to please die hard fans and film buffs has not yet been finished, and will not be released until November 2003. As a result, those who know the story well will feel bits are missing, and those who understand the art of editing may feel that scenes do not run together as well as they might.I am starting to wonder if perhaps the idea that the 'best film' award at the Oscars should be constrained to theatre movies is soon to become out-dated. With movies increasingly using alternative media to fill out the cinematic release (and not just as a way to make money), perhaps it is time to start considering DVD releases and movie concepts. For example the Matrix trilogy is supplemented with TV shorts and video games, which add to the story and the depth of the film. OK, it may not have worked too well in the end, but it won't be the last or best of its type. Maybe there should be a separate award for everything that a movie encompasses; a sort of 'multi-media concept' or 'best movie event' or something. This could judge theatre release AND DVD version, as well as well as looking at the use of the video games to compliment the film and use of TV features to expand the storyline.With the video game industry now outgrowing the movie industry and with the new innovations that are revolutionising the way we understand the movie experience it seems a shame to limit the appreciation of a cultural item such as LoTR solely to what appears on the silver screen."
"absolutely unbelievable! the battle scenes alone make this worth seeing, the sheer scale of them is mind blowing! great acting, great locations, fantastic score (billy boyd's song in particular is incredibly touching). the first film i've ever been to that everyone in the whole theatre gave a huge round of applause when it was over, magnificent film!"
"Yes, it absolutely lived up to my expectations. You get the big sweeping ending with all the heroics you wanted. And the bittersweet goodbyes to some of the better characters in film, ever. Hardcore LoTR fans will miss some scenes, let's hope they show up in the Extended Edition. But the film does great without them. And I at least left the theatre with a tear in my eye and good sense of fullfillment. 10 out of 10!"
"1st film: Enjoyed 2nd film: Was ok 3rd film: Much betterThe film started off really well with a great insight into one of the characters dark past, which did make the little kid next to me squirm a little.This film does manage to provide a little bit of everything of everyones film tastes. It has humour, action and some girlie luv stuff.The one thing that did ""kinda ruin"" it for me was the prolonged ending. I thought I was the only one whose bum was aching for the last scene but a couple next to me had the same sigh of relief when it finally came. Not wanting to spoil it for you but just when the film seems to come to a natural end....well it just keeps going....and going......etc...In summary, well worth the visit to the cinema! Little scary in places for the young ones so watch the parental age recommendation.Eight out of Ten!PS: The special effects: Outstanding!!! Second to none."
"Well....Wow.My mind is still spinning, and I know I probably wont sleep tonight. The awsome power of it is unbelieveable. If you havent yet seen it, drop what you are doing now and run as fast as you can to the nearest theatre playing at that moment! I know that I will watch it again countless times, but I wish I could relive that first time again and again!"
"TROFK has to be one of the best movies I have ever seen.  Not only does it hold true to the book, but it lets you know what happens to each character. I hope this walks away with many film, actor(s), etc. awards.  It deserves to be called the best of the year or even decade."
"What a wild ride!  Not only was it non stop action.  It was also intense emotionally.  If you already care about the characters, you will see them go through hades and back.  It will take me a while to sort it out what I have seen.  They did cut out some major parts from the book, but most of my favourite parts are there in cinematic glory. Hats off to Peter Jackson!  Great ending (s)"
"This was a fantastic film!!!  Epic scenes, fantastic cinematography, and great acting. There were a few drawbacks, but overall I thought the movie was awesome. I wished I could have seen more of Legolas, but alas I may have to wait for the extended edition DVD.  Throw in a few too many slow-motion shots of the actors, and a super drawn out ending, and that's about it for my gripes.  Sean Austin gets my nod for a fantastic portrayal of Sam in this film.  He has a passion for his character that only Viggo can come close to.  Overall an 8.  The weight of this film is just AWESOME. Epic scenes and visual storytelling, but a bit too dragged out in the end.  I just felt it was lacking something...not sure what, but I think I'll see what I was missing when the extended edition DVD comes out.  :)  Peter Jackson for best director, or I'll never watch the Oscars again."
"The Return of The King surpasses all my expectations, it's unlike any other film I've ever seen, it's just the best movie ever made. It just amazes me, the care, search of perfection and effort put on the movie. Peter Jackson, Sideshow WETA, and the rest of the team, along with the actors showed their quality and gave a 100% of them for that project. I truly enjoyed every minute of it, I was on the edge of my seat at the movie theater overwhelmed by this movie which I am sure will be a favorite from generation to generation."
"That is the best movie I've ever seen I think in my entire life.  It take me a full 20 minutes after the end of the movie to recover.  I was simply speechless.  WOW, What a movie.  The emotions in the movie are so thick, it is simply amazing. Special effect are super and the acting is out of this world.   Thanks Mr. Jackson, all the actors and the crew.  That's a wonderfull gift."
"This is an excellent movie.  I would say the best out of the three. Superb acting by all and the special effects were outstanding!  Sean Astin was the best, he deserves an Oscar nom this time.  What an emotional rollercoaster. I will definitely ""return"" to this movie over and over again! A+++++"
"Loved the movie. Thought it was awesome. I do wish they had not cut Saruman out of it thought. I really would have loved to see the confrontation between him and Gandalf. Also wish they had done the scouring of the shire. But those are just tidbits, overall the movie was awesome."
I'm not much of a book reader. I remember going to watch the first Lord of the Ring movie and I thought it was excellent. I saw the second one and it was better than the first one. I just saw Return of the King and by far this was the best of all three. This is truly the greatest trilogy of all time. There was nothing bad about these movies. They are truly perfect in ever way. This one was flawless just like the other two. The action was awesome. I loved every moment of it. I recommend to any fantasy or Lord of and Ring fans.
"Wow, I don't know about everyone else but who's with me for LOTR The Return of the King as the best one yet, and maybe the best of all time?All the fight scenes were unbelievable, the acting was top notch, the writing superb and the special effects were also incredible.It's been a while since I've seen a movie this good, not since Schindler's List or Lawrence of Arabia has a 3 hour movie made me feel this good afterward."
"I am usually not satisfied with movies because I believe that they are going to be great and they usually are not (The Phantom Menace, Matrix Revolutions). This movie was as good as I thought it was going to be and even surpassed my expectations. The acting and the cinematography were superb and although the movie was long, it went too quickly. I cannot wait to go back and watch it again."
"I still cannot believe the awesome effect that this movie had on me. I agree with many of the positive reviews that have been posted. The movie is beyond belief, I only hope that we will see more epic movies like this in the near future. It has been a long time since I have commented on a movie, but WOW... LOTR 3 completely deserves it. Easily my favorite movie of all time."
"The amount of sam/frodo/gollum was too long for a movie. The same sense of pain, frustration and suffering could have been had without subjecting the audience to the same fate. The ending section could have been longer.  I was looking forward to the battle to retake the shire."
"A spectacular and moving conclusion based on one of the greatest epic stories ever written. Definitely one of the greatest adventures committed to celluloid. In spite of the fact the storyline was changed for the movie, Peter Jackson and all those involved have done a fantastic job in bringing this story to the big screen. I hope they bring ""The Hobbit"" to the big screen as well. Admittedly there were a few scenes in ROTK where the visuals were less than perfect. Overall though, the special effects were astounding. On a scale of one to ten I'd still give it an eleven."
"Amazing. That pretty much sums it up. The number of films that move me the way this film moved me can be counted on the fingers of one hand. The scenes, the breathtaking scenery (I've never seen landscape shots like this anywhere!), the characters, the emotions, everything.11 out of 10 :-)"
"More than 9 hours (for the 3 films) to watch the final kiss.Special effects seems of an other age.(King Kong - old version) I agree, it's not easy to recreate the world of Tolkien.But here is a bit annoying. Too long to watch."
"LOTR should be number 2 all time instead of number 164, or whatever it says. You have it listed as having an overall ranking of 8.0, when the voters voted it to have an 8.9.I am very dissapointed that a website as reliable as imdb.com would make such a mistake."
"Over three hours of incredible detail and emotion. Expectations fully met. While the ending was nothing like I expected, it was in no way a disappointment. There's so much to take in. Can't wait to see it again...and again...and again...Still praying for The Hobbit!"
"For all people who were fans of the book, and afraid of what these movies could do to the world that is Middle Earth, fear no more.  The final installment lives up to everything we expected after the first two.  I have never seen a movie hold more true to the books than this series.  Any changes, which were minimal, it seems were done only to save screen time, or more easily develop parts of the book that are hard to do in a movie. Peter Jackson has made an epic trilogy that in my humble opinion is right up there with the first three Star Wars and the Indiana Jones films.  With so much material to deal with he has done an incredible job.  Fans of either the books, or the movies will have no complaints.  Thank you Mr. Jackson for bringing Middle Earth out of Tolkien's imagination and into reality."
"I don't want to spoil this adventure of a lifetime for anyone, so I'll keep it short and sweet.  This is the most amazing human creation I've ever witnessed next to the actual writing of Trilogy by Mr. Tolkien. Just as the books did, this movie will tap into your soul and all your emotions will be the on the ride of their life. Thank you to the cast and crew of this movie for remaining so true to the spirit of the books, and bringing each character to life.  Just as the books did so many years ago, I walked away a lot more human, than when I entered into Middle Earth."
"One can always discuss the details of a certain movie... was the effects flawless? Were the actors good enough? Was the movie too long? Too Short...? Discussions like that about ""Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King"" will undoubtedly be numerous in the time to come. Was the ending correct enough? Was the score fitting...?When I saw this movie at the opening night, in a small theater on the windblown heaths of Denmark, thoughts like that buzzed through my head. And the lack of sophisticated 3D sound equipment and the too small screen, hightened my critical sense somewhat more. And yet, after having dropped my popcorn twice, ungripping fists I didn't know was clenched at least five times, wiping my eyes more times that a grown man wishes to admit and forgot to breath more times than I can remember, all those thoughts were made to shame. This is one of those few films that makes critical views obsolete. once that feeling, you know, gets to you, you know there is no reason to logicalize. This is a movie experience of the rare kind, the kind you feel grips you all the way back to the mythical subconsciousness of us all. An epos that makes petty thoughts on details reasonless. Long live the King!"
"If this is not a 10 then what is. The return of Peter Jackson is wonderful. This film contains everything. It will make you laugh, cry, cheer for the little guy and sit in awe of the beauty. The three hours goes by quickly. You won't feel that you wasted the money to see this one."
"Great all around film. Nice action, nice CGI, nice drama, all that is Lord of the Rings. See this film as many times as you can to support the great team that brought you this awesome trilogy! I would recommend this film to people above 16 or mature younger children because the plot is hard to understand if you are stupid."
"This is the BEST trilogy ever put to film.  Jackson has saved his best for last in The Return of the King.  Simply sensational! If he doesn't get recognised for his works by the Academy, then the film industry is truly screwed.  Can't wait for the extended edition!"
Peter Jackson filled my eyes with so much to see that I came away not sure if I had stepped out of a dream. He mastered the delivery of images of both power and beauty. He juxtaposed these images to weave a tapestry so grand yet also one that appears it could unravel in a heartbeat. All the while he propels the story with a skill Tolkien himself should be proud of. This is a fitting movie to end the trilogy. If completes the series and left me completely fulfilled.
"Immaculate!Yes this film earns a coveted spot next to Fellowship and Two Towers on my list of Immaculate Movies.  Of note, at least to me, is the fact that by being added to my list, LotR, eclipses ""The Godfather"" by being the only trilogy to have all parts represented.  ""The Godfather III"" fell short... ""Return of the King"" did not!"
"I just got back from seeing RoTK today.  I went with two friends (they say it last night at a sneak peek but this was my first viewing of it).  The film is a major epic and highly memorable but it suffers from some major flaws.  It glosses over the conclusion of Battle of Isengard, doesn't bother to explain the Palantir, contains some dry/poor acting and lines (mainly poor jokes revolving around Gimli and Legolas that do not get pulled off well), and the ending is highly inappropriate and disappointing in conjunction with the film.The ending is great but not at the end of THIS film.  The film contains one of the best battle scenes I've ever seen, akin to that from Spartacus,  bringing viewers to an emotional high with adrenaline pumping but then goes into a ""where are they now?"" series of subdued scenes mainly with an orchestral (albeit incredible orchestral) piece serving as the main auditory feature excepting the last scenes in which some dialogue is jutted forth.  Jackson attempted to utilize some of the novel's closure but it turned out to be poorly done/placed in this film.On a more positive note, the film flowed incredibly well and had some of the best special effects I've seen recently in a film that has an overall solid performance (I'm thinking a 6 out of 10).  I'd definately see it again in the hopes that it grows on me."
"Great movie! But it seemed like if Peter Jackson wouldn't know how to finish it, so the last half an hour it's kind of boring, vanishing the good impressions of the whole film. Besides that, I adored the edition, the war scenes and, over all, the Sméagol performance."
"There are not enough superlatives to describe, for those of us that firmly believe in this film, the impact and depth of emotion wrought by this film. My sincerest thanks to all involved that have brought this story to film. Thank you for giving us this wondrous holiday gift!"
"Brilliant. Beautiful. Stunning. Detailed. Mr. Jackson, you have given us a gift. I was completely lost to the movie's glory. I gained interest in the main characters, a RARE thing in a third movie. I loved every minute and had not a single moment of disappointment. Thank you, Mr. Jackson."
"Where to begin? I first read Tolkien's trilogy about 30 years ago and I've been waiting patiently for this incredible odyssey to come to the screen ever since. This final installment was the icing on the cake. I can't heap enough praise on Peter Jackson's vision, and the ensemble of outstanding artists who helped him bring it to the screen for our viewing pleasure. I beheld each scene as I remembered reading them unfold in the pages of Tolkien's written word, and I truly felt that I was once again experiencing a vision of genius that has again found a special place in my heart. Many of you will know what I mean as the journey comes to a climax in this masterpiece. I felt such a terrible emptiness as well, as I saw the familiar tale winding down to it's inevitable ending, and realized with unexpected sorrow, that this was it. No more to come. I can only hope that some enlightened soul will give Peter Jackson & Company an opportunity to bring The Hobbit to the cinema some time in the near future."
"Never have I seen a movie so flawless.  In my opinion, this installment is by far the best of the trilogy.  Often with movies, especially those based off books, I'm thinking ""oh I wish there was less of that, and more emphasis on that.""  Not the case with the Return of the King.  This movie was perfect.  Every aspect about it was stunning and beautiful.  Don't let the three and a half hours thing turn you off.  It's an amazing experience to see this movie.  If it doesn't sweep the Academy Awards it will be a travesty."
"Wow! I'm lost for words. I saw this film at a 7am screening and i have spent the whole  day numbed by an experience similar to the one i last felt many years ago as a child  caught up with the struggle of good vs evil in star wars' empire strikes back. Incredible. Too many jaw-dropping moments, compelling and moving. I'm literally lost  for words.Thank you peter jackson & co for creating a cinematic masterpiece!"
"Return of the King was a fitting and wonderful conclusion to the Lord of the Rings trilogy.   A movie masterpiece.  This one should definitely take Best Picture! Although many items, sub-plots, etc. are missing, I think Jackson did a tremendous job of telling this story (there should be plenty of great stuff on the  extended DVD when it comes).  3 1/2 hours of extreme adventure, emotion and thrills await the moviegoer!"
"Eagerly awaited, this film did not disappoint. More, more, I cry -they're never too long for me. But why were so many tantalisingglimpses from the trailer absent in the film? I'm looking forward tothe DVD EE to add to my collection - maybe they'll appear in that. Iwas also disappointed that Aragorn's powers as healer and theromance between Faramir and Eowyn were not shown; and ofcourse by the lack of Saruman. The whole spectacle is breathtaking, the music sublime, and the locations perfectlyrealised. Can't wait for the Hobbit!! 10/10"
"Hi there! This movie is awesome!Cant wait to get the film next year, with a lot of extra scenes, which weren't in the movie!THE BEST TRILOGY EVER!"
"Saw the midnight showing last night. I was worried about what audience I would get. (It's good to have an enthusiastic crowd but I didn't want hecklers...) They were all great. Bah to all the naysayers. I was glued to my seat. Surely there were improvements to be had but I was having way to much fun just watching the movie. For every Elephaunt (misspelled I'm sure) crashing into another I was feeling like a kid again. Grinning ear to ear. I'll consider myself lucky since I never read the books and don't have the burden of my imagination to contend with like others do. I'm sad it's all over but soon I'll have a wonderful DVD trilogy sitting on my shelf that I can revisit any time I darn well please. Kudos to all involved. I had my fun, and only wish I had this much of  a rush everytime I stepped into the multiplexes."
"Who is George Lucas?, who is James Cameron? who is Steven Spielberg? Sorry guys you are not longer so recognized, since the name of leading directors will bring PETER JACKSON to scene! Lord of the Rings ends in a fantastic sample of vibrating courage and emotiveness. This is the most great and excellent motion picture ever shot, best performance on effects and cast roles, all in a great full package of fun, reflection and after all: the many, many portraits reflected in real life, although the Tolkien universe is fantastic fiction. Hats off to Lord of the Rings!"
Few times in my adult life have I been so moved by a movie as I was moved by The Return of the King. There were scenes that were as near perfect cinematic as you can hope for. The charge of the Rohirrim should be remembered as one of the most amazing pieces of war ever filmed. I have never heard so many sniffles and people blowing their noses as in this showing. This is the perfect ending of an amazing trilogy. 10/10.
"This film is a major achievement.  It is the most wondrous, engrossing and entertaining film I have ever seen.  This will take some beating. The best battle scene ever. Peter Jackson must be rewarded with an Oscar."
"This movie is the best in the trilogi, and i also think its one of the biggest and greatest movies i have ever seen. If you dont see LOTR3 u will miss a big part of the movie history. Also the battles is incredible!GOGO WATCH IT! :)"
"Peter Jackson delivers again; while not perfect, Jackson transports us for a few hours to the wonderful world of Tolkien.  The special effects, acting, and directing allow fans and movie aficionados to lose themselves in Middle-Earth.  I love movies that I can immerse myself in and ROTK is definitely one of those films.Jackson is very skilled at capturing the theme of the books and ROTK does not disappoint.  ROTK is not true to the books and like TTT there are a number of unnecessary added scenes as well as scenes that would have explained things to those who hadn't read the books.  Despite its imperfections ROTK surpasses the expectations fans had for painting such an elaborate tapestry the reflects Tolkien's beautiful but terrible world.Definitely another 10, the strengths of this film soo far outweigh the weaknesses that 10 is the only rating I can give it."
"In my opinion this is the best movie of the series. Alot was changed, but I think the changes made this a better movie. I'm not a total freak and I dont even expect this to be EXACTLY as the book. some things just wouldn't work in a movie. also, a lot was deleted, but as I hope and believe, extended edition will make this movie ALOT better.. easily the best movie of all time, which it already is.acting was good overall, but Theoden (Bernard Hill), Eomer (Karl Urban) and Sam (Sean Astin) really convinced me. EXCELLENT acting from these three guys!I really hope Peter Jackson wins the 'best director' oscar. the directing has been so magnificent in all three movie that it's about the time to take the trophy! the scene where pippin is singing and Faramir is riding to war is already an oscar worth performance!"
"I was sad,happy,amazed,terrified and etc.This is the best end of a Trilogy ever made,it's simply a mind blowing experience in cinema.Much better than the end of Matrix,here i felt that all the story really ended.And with the DVD Extended Edition much will be complete.I have to congratulate WETA for their work in FX,they really did a remarkabull new different world and believable.I aplaude all members of the movie, especially Peter Jackson.You did it!May your work continue for a long time,and i will be watching every new movie you make!"
"I went into this movie expecting something on the level of the Two Towers...very good, visually impressive, but not on the same spiritual and emotional level of the first movie, Fellowship of the Rings. I was surprised and totally awed by a movie that surpassed the first and that I can honestly say is, perhaps, one of the best movies ever made. Visually, it was awe-inspiring to the point where it has to honestly be considered as having the best special effects ever put to film.  But the real impact is the emotional one...the acting, the characterization, the pacing were all simply perfect. I am humbled by the indescribably beautiful work of film that Peter Jackson has delivered to us in his rendition of the Lord of the Rings."
"I have read all the books (including Appendices), I own all the theatrical versions and the extended versions, so I think it is safe to say I am an avid fan...and this movie was amazing!  The music, the acting, the scenery,the story, the battle scenes...absolutely phenomenal!!!!In my opinion, this movie surpasses the first two (which were wonderful in their own rights)...even after 3.5 hours, at 3:30 in the morning, i could have watched two more hours worth!  I will be going again this weekend.
Amazing!"
"Its just plain awesome. My shirt was soaked in sweat. At some times during the battle shivers cascaded down my back and to some touching scenes i had to cry very hard. The audience in the cinema was on the edge of the seats and when Legolas finished of his ""big"" opponent and Gimli said this way cool line the tension exploded in such a loud cheering that i thought i am in a soccer stadium when a goal is scored! I really never experienced something like this in a cinema in my life!!! Really, this lets you fall unto your knees. The Trilogy is now complete and ready to take over the rule in the cinematic Olymp!!!"
"Amidst the eagerness and anticipation I had going in there was a little niggling voice that said, ""But is it going to be everything you hoped? The critics loved it but can the reviews be trusted?""The answer is: yes.  This movie is anything but slow.  It is fast-paced but never loses you (even at 2 in the morning, and I mean that literally.) Some scenes felt a bit disjointed but that will probably be remedied in the obligatory Special Edition Extended DVD.  The scenery was fantastic, especially Minas Tirith and Mount Doom, and the CGI critters like the oliphants were less ""fake"" than they were in FOTR and TTT.  Even Arwen's intrusions were not out of place and helped move the plot along in some cases.  Be warned: the ending is a tear-jerker, just like the book.PJ may have penchant for gore and a dislike for magic but he has the eye of an artist and the mind of a poet.  But keep an eye out for his little jokes (like that old guy in the Shire.)"
"The best of the three... I went to the midnight show last night and was blown away. It was a little slow here and there but all in all, it was everything I had hoped for.  Thank you Peter Jackson.The finest epic battle sequence ever put to film.Shelob(The Giant Spider) was amazing, freaked me out.The special effects seemed better than the first two.I would have ended the movie at the coronation of the King.  A little drawn out at the end."
seriously....best movie ever....if Peter Jackson doesn't win an Oscar for this i will be very angry.....go see it.  its really really good...... I love the books and am a devoted fan but they handled the movies extremely well.  I wish that they would have left in the battle for the shire but i understand.  the movie was fantastic..
"I thought the movie was masterful.  I'll grant that it was long -- very long -- and the ending (multiple endings, really) dragged a bit, but overall, it was captivating and beautiful.  The best word is ""powerful.""  Not only are the battle scenes exciting and terrible, but the emotional involvement with the characters evokes strong responses in the audience.  There were many times I wept for them, or wanted to leap up and cheer for them.I really do think that this movie did the books justice.  Things were changed and cut, yes, but that was to be expected.  Things change in adaptation, but in RotK, they were changed so that the movie was better for it.  Astounding.  Absolutely fabulous."
"If this movie does not clean up at the Oscars there is no justice in the world, three hours has never passed so quickly and the way the stories were intertwined was fantastic. Peter Jackson has done a great job with the first two movies but has saved the best too last. The acting was wonderful and the special effects were seamless, Thank you Peter Jackson for the best ever movie experience."
"This film is by far the best of the trilogy. This could be the one that lands Mr. Jackson that coveted little golden statue. Also, am I alone in thinking the film industry needs to bring back intermission? I mean 3 and a half + hours is an awfully long time to sit without a toilette break."
"Well, being that I was never that big of a LotR fan when it first came out two years ago, I must say that my slight obsession with Orlando Bloom got me to finally sit down and watch the first two movies...now of course after those I absolutely HAD to see the third. THIS MOVIE ROCKED MY SOCKS FROM HERE TO ALBERQUERQUE! This was one of the best movies I've EVER seen, other than the fact, of course that the ending seemed like it kept going. But I mean the battle scenes, Gimili, the slight humor that they even got in there, Gollum arguing with himself...it was just jawdropping and astounding. Mad props to Peter Jackson, Viggo Mortensen, Liv Taylor, Orlando Bloom, Ian McKellen and all the other outstanding actors that were in this series of movies. Bravo!"
"...but on such a high note. The Return of the King is the best of the trilogy in my opinion. Surpassing TTT in special fx and computer animation in the battle scences, and extending the storyline, which I think lacked a bit from TTT. RotK is a stunning conclusion to an epic trilogy; Watch out for the ""oliphonts""Si"
"I just got out of the theatre and my head is still spinning. If there was any doubt that ROTK wouldn't live up to its predecessors - fear not! It's beautiful, impressive, moving, awe-inspiring. Go and see it, it's SO worth it!"
I was a little nervous about being disappointed with ROTK.  I thought it was going to be like Two Towers.  I was on the edge of my seat during the entire movie.  It went by really quickly for me.  I really enjoyed it and felt it was the best of the three.
The Lord of the Rings:  The Return of the King is the last movie in the Lord of the Rings triology.  It continues where the The Two Towers left off and contains the same stunning imagery and special effects as the first two movies.  Anyone who enjoyed the first two will not be dissapointed.David
"The final installment of the LOTR trilogy is jackson's crowning achievement. Not only is it a great film in itself but it binds the other movies together into a perfected, epic, cinematic experience. Beginners and Tolkien fans alike will not be disappointed with the incredible battles, creatures, scenery, character development, and emotion in the grand finale of LOTR. If this does not sweep at the Oscars this year, id say hollywood has lost all self respect and ability to know a masterpiece of film when they see it!"
"I have seen this movie yesterday in the Lord of the Rings marathon. And when you have seen the other 2 movies, you can make a very good comparison. In every aspect of this movie you can see that Pj has put all of his 'powers' in this movie. I think this is better then LotR1 and LotR2 combined. I especially liked the scene where Faramir and his men ride out to save Osgiliath and there is a switch between Denethor eating and the riding of the men.I have read the books 3 times and I thought this movie was the closest to the book in comparison with the other 2 movies.I give this movie a 9,9 (The cutting of the Saruman-scenes, made this movie no 10)"
"Thrilling conclusion to an epic film saga.  As an avid fan of the books, my eagerness to see how the major plots points would play out in Jackson's retelling of the story was sky-high.  My fears were unfounded, though, since for every momentous buildup of emotion and action, there is an immensely satisfying payoff.  Also, whenever I thought the film was about to lapse into cheese (Faramir's sortie to Osgiliath, for example), Jackson and his crew deliver on a poetic level I've never seen in a film of this scale. Bravo for keeping the elements that comprise the film in perspective. Enough of superlatives, though.  Go experience it!"
"Peter Jackson did a great job on this movie, it is packed with action and adventure, and doesn't lag at any stage as the previous 2 may have (in some people's opinions). I saw it at the midnight screening, as I did FOTR, and everyone appluaded when it finished.I won't go into too much depth about the movie itself, because I'm sure many, many more people will... but I really enjoyed this movie. 10/10"
"Although I give this movie a 7/10, I actually enjoyed it a lot less than it may seem. With everyone I knew hailing it as the best film ever, I was overly disappointed in this LOTR installment...yet again. I'm not sure if I enjoyed it better than The Two Towers, but I didn't really enjoy any of them that much. However, the art direction, acting, and special effects were classy, and it deserves a 7/10 as a whole."
I loved it. If the seats in the theatre had been better it would have been a fantasy. Transition from scene to scene was smooth and painless. The action sequences were close up and very detailed. Peter Jackson carried on with the quiet humor from the first two movies added in a very dry subtle way. My only negatives are that gimli was portrayed a little to useless.
"Every scene jumps from the screen, be it mountains - cities - battles - or emotions, from the very begining right through to the music for the credits. I laughed, cried, jumped in my seat and fell in love and didn't mind who noticed. This will be watched again. Thanks"
"The best of the trilogy... if you've seen the other two you cannot go without seeing this one. A perfect cap to the best film adaptation of a book I've ever seen.Worth every cent of my opening-day (he he, 9:00 AM showing!) ticket, without a doubt."
The only thing that are negative is that the film should be longer then it is! This is a film I will see over and over again! Thank You Peter Jackson! My question now are. Was this the end? Or will it come more? Will it be a The Hobbit? That´s for the futune to tell us...
"Just forget the overblown gasbags who pooh-poohed this movie - This is a very well done fantasy film.  Yes there are a few slow sections and a few minor errors, and yes, the story doesn't match the book exactly.  If the movie DID match the book storyline it would be hours longer.But the overall effect if this version is just fantastic and very well-worth seeing on the big screen.Recommend seeing at a quality theater with stadium seating and a good sound system for best effect."
"I won't give anything away bickering over minor details...  Overall this is the best of the three.  Enough said.  My only real complaint during the movie is that my eyes kept drying out because I forgot to blink. :)I'll be able to be more objective after I see it 6 times or so, but for now...  This is undoubtably the best movie ever made.  See it at any cost!"
"Well, as far as I'm concerned this was the best movie I've ever seen in my entire life. It was a lot more violent than the last two, there was a lot more emotion between sam and frodo, and the overall scope was much different from the last two films. I think I may even have liked the music BETTER! (which is hard to get since I'm such a hard-core TTT and FOTR music fan) Anywho, a few people have disagreed with me on where it ranks in the ""best movie list"" but all have said it ranks in their top 5, and I think that's saying alot! = D"
This film grabbed my attention like no other. I do not think any film will again. For three hours and twenty minutes I was transfixed. Quite simply the best film ever made. And then some. Everything else pales into insignificance
"Tolkien's tale is brought to life well in its 3rd and final chapter, and is easily one of the if not the greatest film of 2003. The battle sequences dazzle yet again, and even in their great abundance they dont cease to entertain. The acting is good as well, although i have to say i was a little annoyed during some scenes that seemed too overplayed (when pippin recalls what he saw in the sphere he stole from Gandalf). Things do tend to drag a bit near the end, especially during what will probably be the most parodied scene of the next decade when Frodo awakens near the very end and everyone runs into the room laughing (the scene itself looks like its supposed to be a parody, and gave everyone in the theatre a good laugh).All in all, The Lord of the Rings: ROTK was an amazing movie, well worth its length, with a setting so fleshed out you'll feel like your fighting for middle earth with the rest of the cast."
"After my adventure of sitting through the whole trilogy, I came to a conclusion that it was all was great.  I was disapointed about some items that were left out from the novels like the final return to the Shire and Sarumon (like you didn't know it would happen!) but because of the length of the movie already I can understand why it was cut out (even though they made us quite alot in the Two Towers with Faramir that wasn't needed) It was a day I won't forget.  How long will the exended version of Return be?  I can't wait!"
"This is one of those movies that really NEEDED to be longer, a LOT longer. There are too many things that just get rushed past. I hope the director's cut is at LEAST 4 hours as I think too much of the story was cut out for ""theater pacing"" when the story really NEEDS to be longer.That aside, it was an excellent bookend to the trilogy. Acting,Sets, Costumes, Music, SFx, were all Top Notch."
"NO SPOILERSJust got home from the theatre and I'm still absorbing RotK. Huge is the word I keep coming back to. This movie is so huge it would be Texas if Texas wasn't so messed up. It is 3-plus hours of peak after peak after peak. It has its cheesy moments near the end but they are so rare as to be milked from mountain goats raised by peasant shepherds in Spain. ie, forgivable.Every Rings fan that trusted PJ & Company with this novel is in for a great reward. Even the lack of the Scouring doesn't seem like the major disappointment I thought it would be, if only because there's just so much to absorb in this movie."
"I do not know where to begin with this film, but all I really have to say is that it is WONDERFUL. If you loved the first two of the trilogy, you are going to love the third. It has a balance of seriousness and humor, war and peace, good vs. evil, all wrapped in one package. I seriously doubt you will be disappointed with this one, and if the Academy doesn't give it Best picture....its blind!"
"I have purposely not read any of the books, although I am a big fan of the genre, so I could enjoy the films without worrying about technicalities. I waited in line for 3 hours to get a good seat, and it was well worth the wait.I won't give any of the story away, but it was incredible and visually stunning. The storyline is perfect, ends are tied and the 3+ hour length of the movie flies by so fast you won't even realize it. This will easily be the best film of the year. The LOTR trilogy has surpassed my old favorite trilogy, Star Wars."
"I LOVED THIS MOVIE! Loved it. It was better than I ever thought, or hoped it could be. I went to a midnight showing and even though I got home at 4am and had class at 9, it was totally worth it. There is nothing like going to a midnight showing because you know the only people crazy enough to be there are the true fans. I don't usually like cheering at the movies, but last night I was clapping and cheering along with everyone else. and I'm not ashamed to say I used up five tissues. It had me on the edge of my seat the whole 3 and a half hours and I would have gladly sat for more. I hope Peter Jackson and the rest of the crew get recognized for all their hard work."
"This is a great movie, except they could have cut out the last 20 to 30 min. and had a great move. After the final battle and the destruction of the ring it is over, Someone was actually crying in the showing I was at, for the final 20 min. Get over it people."
"It was wonderfully adapted from the book, and left just enough in to keep book fans happy, but left enough out to prevent non-book fans to stay interested without being confused.  The dialogue was wonderfully scripted, and they didn't overload on the action scenes.  It flowed nicely from storyline to story line, and only a few of the plot lines were left open at the end, which is completely understandable, given the complexity of the story."
"The Return of the King is no doubt the greatest film of all time!!! The film is a masterpiece....i don't see any other film that can surpass the emotion, the drama, the action that this film had. Those who doubted Peter Jackson will eat their words when they see this film. What Peter Jackson did with this film will touch every person who sees it. It will forever change the way we see films.This film definitely deserves an Oscar. So does Sean Astin, Ian McKellen and Viggo Mortensen. The cast namely: Orlando Bloom, John Rhys-Davies, Miranda Otto, Cate Blanchett, Hugo Weaving, Bernard Hill and the 3 mentioned above, etc. definitely deserves an award for their performance as an ensemble. And most of all Peter Jackson definitely deserves an Oscar."
"No trilogy in history has ever had as great a conclusion as this movie is. I can't say a lot about it, since I just saw it today, on the opening day. I don't want to spoil it.  However, the special effects, the cinematography, the acting, and everything was just absolutely breath-taking.  Gondor was awesome.  Mordor was just like the pits of hell.  And it all fit perfectly. Tolkien would have been proud!"
"What can I say other than the movie was completely awesome. And was better than the 1st and 2nd one combined!!! Deffinitely worth seeing in the theater multiple times! The movie stayed very true to the book, except for a few minor things that just could not be put in because of the time it would have taken to do so. Like Saruman  was not in it at all....but that didn't bother me too much in the grand scheme of things. The movie stayed very true to the characters.This is a must see as soon as possible for any Tolkien fan!"
"This was a spectacular film!  I mean, I've read the books and all, but this one tops it all!  The first and the second movies left out some parts to be desired, but this one literally followed the book chapter by chapter.  They started out the beginning very well and ended it well, too.  I can't wait to see it again!"
"I had the privilege of seeing the movie a day before it was in theaters. Actually, I've seen all three of them in a row! And if I attempt to describe this movie in one word, it would be: Astonishing!Peter Jackson has done a wonderful job, and the ending is just 'wow'! This movie is definitely a recommendation for everyone!"
"I give it a 10 because its a perfect ending to a perfect story..I think that the very end in which is after the battles is over done. Otherwise it was a very good movie. Very good story, and battle scenes. It has a little of everything."
"Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy takes its place -- alongside the symphonies of Beethoven, the pyramids of Egypt, and the original books by J.R.R. Tolkien -- on the list of the greatest creative achievements in human history."
I've just seen this movie and I feel a bit disappointed that I'm not that much excited that I want to be. The beginning of the movie is very good with the review of Gollum. It makes you understand more why he has become what he is. The battle of Gondor is the highlight of the movie but it gets destroyed of an army of undead immortal troops that I can't remember from the book. All the excitement is gone when the good side suddenly have an army you can't kill. The spiderscene never gives you the scaring feeling you want. It was done much better in Harry Potter actually. Some mediocre acting skills mixed with some goods ones. Sean Austin was very good while Orlando Bloom and Viggo Mortensen have more to prove. The ending feels a bit too long and leaves some things out. For example the faith of Gimli and Legolas.7/10
"There's nothing much to say about this movie, other than that it was amazing. Nothing else quite describes it. Fantastic ending to a fantastic story. The flow of this film was great. Not many slow parts at all. Gives you a sense of whole, or completeness that Matrix could not come close to. Filming these films all in one shot really gives it that advantage of making it all seamless unlike other trilogies or sequels that just don't measure up.Another spot is anxiously waiting on my DVD shelf for this one.10 out of 10...the perfect movie."
"There are hardly words to describe the event of seeing this film.  It is people fighting for freedom.  They are honorable and dignified.  They give speeches to motivate that not only motivate their fellow man, but brought most of the people on our row of the theater to tears. More than that, it gives hope to all in such a profound and touching way. I have never seen an audience so still and quite at the end of the movie. It was so moving that few even spoke, and those that did used hushed tones to preserve the mood.  Is it long?  YES!  Some might say the end drags out a bit - I say NO!  I am thankful Peter Jackson took the time to re-establish that there had been peace brought to the lands and lives of these characters we have come to love over the last three years. This film will go down in history. There are hardly words..."
"How do you condense the ultimate crusade against evil into a ten hour film? How do you capture the depth of the written word with lighting and CGI? How do you encompass the power in Lord of the Rings in a swordstroke or an embrace? The brilliance of Peter Jackson's ""Lord of the Rings"" is its ability to perfectly capture a single emotion, be it love, camaraderie, betrayal, or despair, and embrace it through visual effect. Every scene in this movie contains within it one idea, masterfully expressed by Tolkien, and uniquely captured by Jackson; every camera angle, every dash of makeup, every facial gesture and reaction in each scene attempts to recreate the ""single effect"" Tolkien intended. And every attempt is successful. Consider the precipice on the thousand steps where Frodo is deceived, misguided into mistrust. Consider the tavern scene near the end of the movie: no words are spoken, yet none are needed; this is the power of the movie. Before leaving my seat at the movie theater, I was overcome with a sense of indescribable emotion and infinite depth. After much time and consideration, I realized that I had been struck repeatedly by scenes of true emotive power, unclouded by excess and uninhibited by thought."
"Peter Jackson has done an admirable job of depicting this epic trilogy on screen.  This movie, while boasting a 3:30 run time (3:15 if you don't count the previews), does a good job at finishing the story.As a Tolkien fan, I am disappointed in the material that was left out of this film.  I realize that, if all the storylines were included and given a just amount of time, this movie would run near 5 hours.  I hope that in the extended edition (which will hopefully be released BEFORE next November) they will add back in a significant amount of storyline.My only complaint about this movie was the ending.  Yes, they left out a lot of the story, but the worst part for me was the extended emotional endings and the pointless fades that only served to extend the movie 20 minutes beyond what was necessary. Sam does way too much crying for my liking. I'm guessing that these scenes were added for emotional appeal for those that require high emotional content to their movies.  So, if you are one of these people, then you will love this movie.  Not only does it have non-stop action and story, but the ending will be up to your emotional standards as well."
"I really liked the movie, but the end was just to long, i wanted to leave for the last 35 minutes, i know they wanted to tell the story true, but i would have rather seen more in depth action scenes than the ending being dragged out, i'll get it on dvd, but when it gets to the end im not watching it again. im sure ill get flamed for saying that."
"I thought movie was well done, in fact my only real compliant is that is seemed rushed.  I know it sounds odd calling a movie this long rushed, but that had to do with the incredible amount of material that needed to be covered.  I thought the acting was great, especially by Andy Serkis, and Sean Astin.  I think they really brought out the emotion in thier characters.  The visuals were of course stunning.  Many hardcore fans may be upset be the ending being altered, but the book ending would not have worked well on film, nor would it have fit.  Overall I gave it a 9."
"Just back from the midnight show and all I can say is wow. Manages to somehow surpass the 1st two in every way. If Andy Serkis doesn't win an oscar for his performance as Gollum/Smeagol it's a joke, oh wait those awards usually are. Sean Astin and Sir Ian also deserve recognition. I only hope there is truth to the rumors of Peter Jackson making ""The Hobbit"". It's rare that I deviate from my normal shut-in routine, but I will be seeing this in the theater again, the way it must be seen. Amazing"
"Forget these ""gentle, little films"" like Lost in Translation or Station Agent -- this is what I call a REAL movie.  It is outstanding in every way. While I felt the first two LOTR films dragged and I couldn't get into them, this final chapter kept my interest from the opening scene.  Truly spectacular!"
"The final part of LOTR was as good as the anticipated wait for this film. The film itself, was one that you just knew would be fantastic before even seeing it. And thankfully it was. I must admit that at first, back when the Fellowship was coming out that I was just so-so about the films. But oh my God, what I wasn't expecting was the 3 year treat we were all about to recieve. Kudos to everyone involved with LOTR, and it's sad that's it's all over and done with. This was the best of the 3 movies."
"I absolutely loved this movie! Not only is it the best of the series, but it is also the one that most closely matches the books in terms of the 'feel' of Tolkien and Middle earth.An Outstanding achievement!"
"I have never been a fan of fantasy, nor have I read the ""Lord of the Rings"" novel when virtually everyone did in high school. I knew many people loved the book to the extreme, but I never gave it a second thought. However, the films that were translated from Tolkien were magnificent, in particular this concluding one! This trilogy is about as perfect as we can ever expect from movie-making, and I was even sad to see it end. Wouldn't it be great to see movies like this come out every year??  We've certainly been spoiled by this one, that's for sure! I relished in the action, adventure, romance, and mythology of this series. The music, cinematography, characters and scope make this trilogy one for the ages.  Even if you are not a fan of fantasy (like me), do yourself a favor and go on the ""Rings"" journey!"
"What can I say about this movie? I think anyone who watch the movie can say the same, 'cause there's only one word to define this movie: Perfection. Maybe everybody won't think that but remember: Perfection is different for each one of us..."
This is by far the best of the 3 sequels. I personally feel this has got to be the best movie of 2003. It is a must see. The fight scenes and the acting have truly culminated into one of the best cinema experiences I have ever experienced.
"As the summary says. This movie was so great that it's hard to describe it. When I saw the battle at Gondor and the battle in Middle Earth I felt that my body was freezing. It was so very cool and I got endorfin in my body! Wow, a GREAT feeling!Nothing was bad with this movie, everything were perfekt! It is the best movie I've ever seen in my life."
"Without having seen the extended version yet, I vote Return of the King with an 8. It is without doubt one of the most impressive movies ever made and it follows the story and plot of the book fairly. The really great movies must have more than exhilarating action and breathtaking special effects. This is exactly the lack of Return of the King. It simply gives you nothing further to think about. It is anti progressive, which is necessary to be loyal to Tolkien. Peter Jackson managed to get almost the very best out the book(s), but it could never be able to reach the peak, although he gave it a good shot."
I was incredibly happy with the way Peter Jackson did the last installment of Lord of the Rings. He kept all the major plot occurences from the book and transformed them into a visual presentation of the book! The ending was so parallel to the boo kthat it had near the same affect of instilling emotion into me as the book did. Therefore I think that RoTK is one of the best movies this year and in the history of filmmaking.
"I left the theater on December 16th without the words to describe what I have just seen. I still don't, really. No other movie has done that to me since Braveheart. No other movie has moved me to complete and utter shock then Return of the King. Shock that it was so good. Shock that I actually wasn't DISAPPOINTED for a movie i've been waiting for for years. Shock that I actually cried to a movie picture. It took me a whole day to become un-overwhelmed, and I just had to see it again. The second viewing solidified the movie as The Greatest Movie Ever Made(at least to me)The scenery was beautiful. The acting was flawless. Give Sean Astin and Ian McKellen the Oscar. Now. Sean Astin's Samwise Gamgee and Ian McKellen's Gandalf WILL go down in movie history as two of the most beloved film characters.A few cuts from the book left me a bit disappointed, but it didn't spoil the film on a whole for me one bit. They will be in the Extended Editions DVDs, so I'm not too worried about it.All and all, the greatest movie ever made. Bar none. Move over Godfather, here comes Return of the King."
Great Move. Although the movie was slightly different than the book itself. The special effects and the intensity of the characters were remarkable. I would recommend this movie to all my friends. The movie got better and better since the 1st part. I have watched part 2 about 10x and will do the same with the 3rd. I hope they come up with the trilogy to buy it all at the same time.
"Movie was fantastic.But there is about 25 minutes of long goodbyes at the end boring.Great action scenes, best action movie i seen so far this year.Sam should be nominated for best supporting actor, and it should be nominated for best picture and best director at the academy awards."
"was very good. stayed fairly true to the book. very entertaining, the hours flew by :) special effects were amazing, would almost believe all the places were real. was a fitting ending to the filmed trilogy and a tribute to tolkien's work. hopefully the films will bring more people to the books. if you've not seen it, GO."
"As a huge fan of both the movie and the books, I am delighted to see how closely Peter Jackson has tried to follow the end of the story as Tolkien would have intended.  Sure, there were a few omissions that I found disappointing, but until I've seen the extended cut, I won't even complain about that.  This was a wonderful cap to the journey Jackson has made of the LotR series."
"It was the best film I have ever seen and could watch it over again. It was quite disappointing that Saruman wasn't in there, but because of that you had a slightly happier ending. If he had been in there, the film would have been 45 minutes longer.Anybody that is still confused should read the book rather than wait a year until the extended version comes out."
"Peter Jackson delves deep into the works of Tolkien to bring to life the emotions of the denizens of Middle Earth.  The three hours and eleven minutes of the movie leaves the watcher gasping, hoping, yearning!  At the end you don't want it to end and you are left with a sence of serenity and peace.  It is a must see movie for all who love Tolkien and the Lord of the Rings series."
"I adored this movie. If it doesn't get an Oscar for Best Picture, something is very rotten in La La Land. It was uniformly superb. The battle scenes were stunning. I got dizzy watching them! I applaud Peter Jackson and the rest of the Fellowship."
"Before I saw ROTK, I read probably close to 100 online reviews, and with one or two exceptions, everyone raved about this movie.  Now I know why.  This is a spectacular movie on its own.  But when ROTK is seen in the context of being the concluding third of the LOTR trilogy, it defies description. There were moments when I felt my chest tighten in awe.No-one steals the show - every last actor is nothing short of superb.  But for me personally, Samwise Gamgee deserves honourable mention.For the pedantic purists who want a ""Harry Potter"" style, page-by-page, line-by-line adaptation, you may be a little disappointed.  For the rest of us, it doesn't get any better.ROTK was everything I hoped for and more, and I relish the thought of seeing it many more times."
"I was overwhelmed by this film. I felt like an evil little wormtongue when I saw the amazing battles and the amazing EVERY thing. I cried like a little baby throughout the entire film. The energy IS splendid for this film. This movie does it for me. I have to say that the Lord of the Rings trilogy to me is what the Star Wars trilogy is to my parents. I am proud to say, look at this amazing epic in my generation. This is a giant step in the right direction for epic movie making. On a scale of 1-10 I give it a 15. Mad crazy and awesome. Great job crew and cast of LORD OF THE RINGS."
"I have seen many films in my lifetime & this has to be one of the most impressive of all. In terms of a series, no other series can even come close in terms of storyline, fluidity from the first to the last as well as genius in completing the story. As to Steve from Alberta, I would politely disagree as to the role of Arwen in the final installment. She completes a most important love story & gives additional meaning to the life of Aragorn. Every great leader should have his love at his side.After all, she was part of his inspiration in the journey to press on. The kiss at their reunion, after his crowning, was electric. The genius of Peter Jackson gave us closure to all major aspects of this epic. I rate this one as a definite A+"
"And it sure is beautiful this movie. I sat on the premiere trying to keep the tears from coming because if one tear came all of them would be unleashed. The most important thing in the movie was that so much from the book came into this production. Great work Peter.... Thank you on the behaf of the true Tolkien fans, the movies are really important but Tolkien will always move our hearts in a special way..."
"It´s one of the best movies I have ever seen. The Return of the King is spectacular, full of powerful, adventure and emotion. Peter Jackson has made an enormous work with this trilogy, chapeau!!! ONE ADVICE: This movie is in the third place, but it would be the first (appears 9.1 but it´s rated with 8.8) bye!!"
"A worthy conclusion to the greatest trilogy of movies ever made.  I mean, how many times does the third movie live up to the first two?  Superman III? Return of the Jedi?  Godfather III?   I might be willing to grant Police Academy III... anyway - great movie!"
"I watched the final instalment in the trilogy today with my family. Afterword, something occured to me.  My reaction to the first film was 'Wow!'. After watching the second installment, my reaction was 'WOW!'. Now I have seen the final chapters of the film.  My reaction - 'WOW!!'.  I have never had a series of films impress me the way that each of these did, both singularly and as a whole.This final instalment of the epic tale is an emotional journey through excitement, awe, rage, desperation and sadness with the character's we love. The climax of the series reaches critical mass, then leaves us wanting more, but understanding that it cannot be.The specail effects, sound, and CGI use in the film were all outdtanding. The Soundtrack Orchestration was once again as much of the film as any of the characters.A masterfully done work.  Thank you too all involved."
"Oh, should I buy the trilogy? Oh my God!This question is just stupid. I can't wait to have the trilogy right here in my hands. ;-)It was just great I saw a revolution on cinema industry happening. Those three movies (that I'll count as one) were really beautiful."
"This movie was full of beautiful scenery, action, music scores and fantastic actors. They made this film seem realistic. After watching the first film, I was hooked.  Couldn't wait for the next two. Yes, it is long, but you get your monies worth!"
"I saw this movie today, and I felt sad leaving the cinema, sad because the journey was over. For the 3rd Christmas in a row I have spent over 3 hours of my life in a Cinema hall to see if the Movies could live up to the books, the films have certainly bought the spirit of JRR Tolkiens story to the screen successfully. I won't go into how good an adaptation this movie was, instead I would like to talk about it as a Movie in it's own right - and it was great.I don't think I have thought 'Wow' or 'F***ing hell' to myself so many times during a movie as i did today during ROTK. There were some jaw-dropping scenes; shot beautifully, but importantly complimented by some very good acting and some really touching ones too.I really need to watch it again to take everything in, so much is said and done in this movie (at times it felt quite rushed despite it's length).
9/10 - I expect the extended edition to improve this!"
"This hair-raising and action packed film may have some fans choosing the quietly dramatic second installment as their favorite but, everyone must agree that this is one of the finest movies ever made. In every way it meets the audiences expectations and surpasses them. The battle sequences set a new standard for both action scenes and visual effects. All will also agree the old-world theatrical choice of multiple formal endings to the story lags a bit but, the smile stayed on this viewer's face to the bitter end. Only the very cynical will not be left breathless by this fantastic and stunning work."
"A big fan of the trilogy, I liked this movie very much. I hope that the extended version will bring us a bit more of the characters Faramir and Eowyn, which were nicely developed earlier, but somehow didn't make the cut here. Pippin's song was my favorite moment."
"But WHAT happened with the endings? Could they have made this any longer? I knew something was wrong when the good guys win and there is still 30 minutes left in the movie. Please - leave some out for our imagination, or as an incentive for those who haven't read the books to go back to JRRT's source. However, a great film all around and pretty true to the classic books."
"I had high, high hopes and expectations for this movie. As a fan of both the books and the movie, I was anxious to see this tale portrayed beautifully and truthfully on the big screen... and boy, did it deliver!At no time did I feel let down or unsatisfied, the whole experience wrapping up the adventure nicely. I can't wait to see it again, and again and again!P.S. I wonder if they'll have an extended edition? I didn't mind the length of this movie (hey, I didn't want it to end), but if it gets any longer, I'll need to bring along a cushion!"
"This is film is simply amazing.Admittingly the begin was somewhat slow, but as soon as it the story begain to pick up it was just consuming.  The visual effects were just as spectacular as ever but it is the acting of some of characters which is truly impressive.  There so much you can say about this movie, but all you can say is Long Live The King.  If no oscar is given to this its a  farce to all movies."
"Had the director removed the long gazing looks between the halflings, respected the audience to remember the story of Golem and limited the movie to one ending, I would have given it a much higher rating and been fairly excited about the movie.As it is, find a theater with big seats, lots of leg room and sneak in a beer or two..g"
"This,my fellows, is nothing but a clean masterpiece.Peter Jackson has done it again and this movie,the last,was awesome!Why?Battle on Pelennors field for one thing,Pippins song is another,Frodos inside battle...and Samwise Gamgi."
Amazing. Breathtaking. Emotional. Epic.The Return of the King is the final chapter in the greatest cinematic trilogy ever. It is a spectacular achievement of filmmaking and it eclipses the scope and sheer amazement of any movie in recent memory.
im truely lost for words..some of my friends (well they used to be) never liked LOTR 1 and never bothered to watch LOTR 2.. even my mom didnt like it... i'm gonna disown myself hehe.. Peter Jackson and the entire cast and crew has made me happy 3 years in a row.. and I so wish there could/would/should be a 4th and 5th and 6th and... installment..just lovely
"Thank you Peter Jackson, Ian McKellen, Viggo Mortenson, Elijah Wood, Orlando Bloom and everyone that worked on the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Thank you for bringing Tolkien's wonderful story to life.  I don't know what to say about The Return of the King except that it was exceptional. I didn't look at my watch the entire movie. If you thought the ending was too long or the story wasn't developed enough then you didn't read the books and you didn't see the friendships and patriotism of sorts that was so powerful in the movie.Wonderful, wonderful movie. Read the books. See the movies. Love the story."
"This movie really is incredible. It is like putting the dot over the I. Incredibly breathtaking and i love it. I love the characters. I am glad that the movie is a success because I was sceptical at first.I am looking forward to seeing the extended version.Amazing, fantastic,...Saxxxon"
"With all the media hype preceded the movie, I was bit suspicious about ROTK's ability to meet the expectations but now I can safely say that it not only met my hyped expectations but exceeded those.War sequences are marvelous. All members of fellowship play an important role in this final chapter of the movie. All answers have been provided.In short, one of the best movie of our times.My Rating: 10/10"
"That was the best movie i have ever seen. There is EVERYTHING in that movie. Action, Drama, and thriller. The battle seens are amazing and can not be found in any other movie. This movie will not be forgtton soon. I GIVE THIS MOVIE A 12 OUT OF 10! But since i can only give it a 10, well thats what i gave it. PURELY AMAZING!!!!!!!"
"Tolkien would be pleased and proud, that Peter Jackson has visualized his books in this grand scale. It is a masterpiece from both. The Return of the King is the best movie of all time. It has all the elements, from the book and that is an undertaking like no other from PJ and his team. This movie deserves to win, at the academy awards next year. Tolkien & Jackson are the kings who have returned."
"movie was a wonderous technological acheivement, unparalleled. Very clean, cinematographically flawless. Beyond well executed, technologically. But for all the visual awe and excitement, it lacked emotional edge. This is because it lacked believability and personal identification. Strip away all the cgi, etc and were left with awkward editing, mediocre acting, and trite, overused character employment.  omissions made the movie too methodical. Didnt flow. Dumbed-out dialogue left me without identification with the cause. Where's the challenge? This is what I learned from the movie: protagonist die > friend protagonists sad. protagonist live= friend protagonist happy. Bad guy die = protagonist happy. The movie was an emotional simpleton, full of cliches.  and above all this, I was still not convinced that the ring was that important. Jackson failed to bring me to understand why the ring was so powerful; the only conscious allusion to it's importance in the entire trilogy was in the beginning of the first movie when we were briefed about its powers, and then abandoned; left to accept its worth with barely a sort of narrative indication to me of its  value, origins, backstory etc - only to know that yes, everyone has always seemed eager kill for ""my preeecious"". Maybe being atheist has to do with my inability to buy into what I feel should be the most expressly and carefully told part of the story, because, the ring was like God, with no beginning, we have only to accept it's importance b/c peter jackson says so. And how about the eye? what was its role in the grand scheme of things? How abour Sauron? what happened to him?"
"Yup. Words can't describe it. I'm just surprised the masses like it too... but heh, I guess you can't fool them every time.The story is incredible... the basis for all fantasy and such in the modern world. This movie somehow translates it so well and then some. Just excellent."
"The ROTK may not be the best movie of all time, but it is definitely top 5, and without a doubt top 2 of my lifetime, only because I was like 5 minutes old when The Godfather was released, and The Godfather is a film without equal.  I have always answered the question ""Have you read the lord of the rings?""  with the answer. ""It is not have I read the Lord of the Rings, but how many times have I read the Lord of the Rings"".  Well my answer will be the same for these 3 films, and ROTK in particular.  In my opinion had the extended version of this film (admitidly I have not seen it, and am only speculating on its quality)been the theatrical release I probably would have rated it # 1.  As it is This movie and its 2 predecessors are among my favorite of all time.  Peter Jackson, well done!"
"Peter Jackson and co. have done a simply stunning job with these films. They fuse visual, dramatic and thematic elements in an unparalleled cinematic triumph of incredible beauty and poignancy. My only ""criticism"" of the Return of the King is that I know that the extended version, as with the previous two films, will be even better.  This is truly a special and unique contribution to the art of cinema the greatness of which will only become clearer with time."
"This is the greatest movie ever. The series just kept getting better and better! The actors and actresses were superb and the graphics and scenery, as always, were wonderful. 1,000,000,000,000,000 stars out of 10!"
One can't do a film like this justice by reviewing it. Every attempt to capture the experience in words falls flat.This is the best film I have ever seen in my life. Awesome. Simply Awesome.
"What can you say about this giant money maker of a movie, it's a nice little film. Take away all the special effects and the powerful musical score and you got a universal story about good verse evil in a time universal to our own. Unlike most of the movies of 2003, this will stand the test of time and be watched by generations to come. It will last a thousand years for the simple reason of it being a simple, and somewhat, little film."
"This is by far the best in the trilogy.  All three films are outstanding but this by far is the best.  The only thing I didn't like in the film, I thought the ending went on 20 minutes longer than it should have.  But what a great way to end probably the best series in movie history.  This movie is a Best Picture contender hands down!! If you haven't seen this film yet, I highly recommend that you do."
"what can i say about this movie. well,it one of the best movie of all time. i saw this movie for the second time last night and came away from it thinking what a great movie and how it made me feel.i have to been to movies where i came out and say to myself what a waste of money and time ,but with this movie i would spend all my money and spend all my time watching it. i cant understand how some people don't like this movie. peter jackson take a bow.you are the best and i am proud to be a new zealander when guy like you have done such great things for new zealand. the cast are the best ,and i take my hat off to them ,because to, film three big movie in a year and make them great is wonderful. this movie should get the  best film ,if it doesn't then the people who vote for them should have their heads look at. again ,well done to all of the lord of rings cast and crew 10\10"
"Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King.  Is an historic epic film in the modern age of Hollywood.  The storyline is very well done.  The Cinematography byAnnie Collins and Jamie Selkirk was breathe taking.   Director Peter Jacksonand Frances Walsh has inspired young movie makers for the generations. Great story and screenplay.  Four stars.

"LOTR: Return of the king is an amazing movie.  I saw the trilogy on December 16th, and was very impressed.  It was all that I expected and more. Obviously a must see, but I think it was just that much better because I got to see all 3 one after the other.  Hats off to Mr. Peter Jackson for a great interpretation of J.R.R. Tolkiens masterpiece."
"I could wright 1000 words saying how good it was, that the 3 hours were over within 10 minutes, that the visuals were stunning, the actors performed great, etc ... even then i will miss a lot of it. Watching ROTK was like feeling in general, can i describe it accuratly? No. Just these two words: best ever...Will it win the important the Oscar's? Not likely, will they give the price 2 best movie to a New Zealand director who shot it all in his native country?? No way ..."
"Peter Jackson was right: this is the best movie of the series - and that is saying something because The Two Towers was superb.  The correct genre for the Lord of the Rings series is horror/fantasy and never before has horror or fantasy been attempted on such a grand scale.  The scenery is stunning, the action sequences spectacular, the horror superbly done.  There is some humour, a perfectly blended music score and, of course, computer imaging without peer.  The character of Gollum/Smeagol is one of the great achievements in cinema history and the battle scenes pure genius.  Need I say more: this is one of the cinema's true masterpieces, a stunning finale to a superb series."
"Having loved the first two, I eagerly awaited the concluding installment of LOTR - and wasn't disappointed.The sfx are awesome; in particular the aerial shots and, of course the battle scenes.The three and a half hours in the cinema sped by, a tribute to the engrossing nature that has been the feature of all three films.Cinematography has reached a new plateau."
"Much too often these days, superlatives are thrown around to describe the greatness of movies and music. In this case, any superlative used is an understatement. This is unlike anything that has ever been made and probably ever will be made. Few films I have seen can stir as many emotions as effectively as ROTK. After more than three hours, the film still leaves the audience wanting more. If there is any justice, ROTK would sweep every awards ceremony in existence. Combined with Fellowship and Two Towers, the unprecedented trilogy helmed by Peter Jackson towers over any achievement in the medium in scope, character, and impact. The bar has been raised and the standard has been surpassed. Motion pictures will never be the same."
"This film is sweeping and epic yet never manages to lose its human touch. It has a message for each and every one of us and is as varied and personal as the many faces of Middle Earth.  If you take nothing from this film other than this, you will be the richer: this is an important, a VITAL film because it has something to teach everyone and we are all the better for it."
"I might be the only one brave enough to admit it but this movie was truly disappointing. I thought to myself, where is Christopher Lee? I was looking forward to seeing him in the film but he wasn't here. The entire film was somewhat disappointing. However, one cannot fault the special effects. They were whizmical. No, its certainly not an awful film, quite the opposite. All I'd say is that its not quite up there with the first two. Perhaps if Christopher Lee was in it, I would have given it a better review. This is one plot hole that was seriously mishandled. Rob"
"PERFECTION has to be the best word to describe this terrific movie. It has everything you could ever want including a great story, characters, direction, editing, sound music, effects, acting, funny lines, settings. I could go on forever with praise talking about how outstanding this movie is and how emotional it was.It has to be the greatest movie ever made. FOTR and TTT were both terrific as well but this one has to be the best of all three by far. Once I walked out that cinema theatre I was just blown away and knew it was and if you haven't seen it yet then let me tell you now. This movie will take your breath away. Enjoy now and for many milleniums to come!Outstanding! 1000000000000/10"
"Yes, we can!  I mean honestly, what more can we say about an ultramod finale to the LOTR trilogy.  Everything from Billy Boyd's singing, to Orlando's every move...perfection.  Shore's music combined with every camera shot makes for an incredible, oscar-winning film.  The cast is comprised of talented individuals that bring Tolkien's book to life.  It does what it can, and as for the long ending that some audience members feel is too long...how could the film possibly end any sooner? The story itself is huge, so with all respect to finding closure in each aspect of the storyline, every moment of the ending is necessary. (And to the LOTR diehards...who wants to end the movie?) This is an absolutely fabulous movie, period."
Excellent film! The battle sequences in this movie were as Peter Jackson predicted - 100 times more gripping and mesmerizing than the Helms Deep battle in The Two Towers. Jackson has remained true to the spirit of the books in all aspects of the story he has told. He couldn't have done any better!
"It is just that good. I didn't read the books, and that hampered me raving about the first of this series, but I have to top my hat to the director on the Return of the Kings. As Alison noted, it now makes the original Star Wars trilogy second rate, and the latest trilogy (episodes 1-3) even more of a joke."
"Yeah, I'm happy. I first read the trilogy in 1970, at 14. I've read it at least 20 times since then, the last being in 2000 when the excitement was starting. I have to say I expected to be severely disappointed, as I am by almost every movie made from a book that I like. PJ did the best job that today's technology could render and viewer's butt's could stand. I can't tell you how many times I thought ""That's exactly how I pictured it!"" during this movie and the first two. I had moments of displeasure with changes and omissions but they were two few to mention based on the sheer quantity of storyline and character development in the novels that Jackson faithfully followed. A grand achievement overall, and ROTK is the crowning gem in the three movies. But I gush...I'm sad too. I'm sad it's over, and can't wait for The Hobbit, if the proposed project comes to fruition. I was sad after finishing the trilogy too, every time I've read it. To me that means it's a damn good book or film.All I can say is, if you haven't seen it, what are you waiting for?"
first film i ever seen where i felt like never watching another film again because ya cant get any better! And i had the worst seats in the house and horrible seats as far as sound yet i still thought it was the best! 10/10
"When I saw the third part of this trilogy, I realized it didn't need to be a trilogy.  The second part could have been left out.  It had way too much fighting in it.  I would say the same thing about this one but there was enough plot, setting, and character development to make this the best one of the lot.  While the Fellowship of the Ring laid the necessary groundwork, the King Returns tied all the loose strings together rather nicely."
"All I can say is Mr. Jackson and the gang have outdone themselves considerably.  The SFX work was by far the best I'd seen on film to date, and the flow of the story was done quite well.  Not to mention his use/accuracy of the timeline in the film, is outstanding.  I'd almost say he didn't skip or misplace a beat in the entire film.  The best part of the whole movie has to be that Jackson and crew actually finish off the entire book....by that I mean this movie really could have ended at the destruction of the ring (even though the book calls for more), but Jackson finishes the film in style and even adds a small bit to it in the end, but what an addition!  I say bravo to you Mr. Jackson, and to your entire crew, a trilogy that can properly be called ""The Lord of the Rings""!  Thank you."
Absolutely Positively Undeniably marvelous. there's really nothing else to be said.
"I've read the books, and now I've seen the movies. Like the previous ones, this movie was an enormous accomplishment, with sweep and grandeur and pageantry and fantastically creative monsters. Unfortunately, they should have left about an hour of it on the cutting-room floor. I'm sure it'll win a bevy of Oscars and other awards, but for my money a movie such as ""Mystic River"" is ""better."""
It deviated from the book a bit and left out some stuff I was looking forward to but it was perfect for the movie.  The first movie left out a lot from the book that I felt SHOULD have been left out.  I think Peter Jackson did an excellent job with the whole series.  I never even watched the first one until a week before the 2nd one came out because I thought for sure it was never going to live up to the books.  Well it did!  Almost all the changes were right on the money and the story and dialog follow the movie very well.  For all the haters out there they need to look at The Cat in the Hat and see just how bad it could have been and thank PJ for something that I will be proud to show my children.  They will still have to read the books first!
"This has to be the best movie I have ever seen in my entire life! The acting, the storyline, the action and the end of an amazing trilogy!
I must have cried about 18 times throughout the movie, the time flew by and I never wanted it to end. The characters and the bonds you form with them is so rare, I have never gotten into a movie so much!Please see it, you won't regret it! I loved this movie and want to see it again and again!Overall: 10/10P.S Doesn't Pippin have a gorgeous voice?"
"Granted - I'm a bit biased - I love Tolkien and believe Jackson has done justice to the series.  However, I believe that anyone who sees this last film in the trilogy will marvel at its fluidity, wonder at its marvelous scenary and special effects - and more importantly - fall in love with the world that Tolkien and Peter Jackson have created.  Though this is a lengthy movie - I never once ""felt"" the length during the viewing at the theater. The acting was marvelous, the editing superb! I had tears in my eyes within the first hour simply because of the magnitude of what Jackson has done.  I can harldy wait until next year when the extended DVD comes out. My husband and I are huge movie fans - and I believe this is truly one of the best movies I have ever laid eyes on.  It deserves the Oscar and I would recommend anyone who loves a good movie to go see this - in the theater - and without delay."
"This was the best movie I've ever seen. No joke. Best of the three movies. It gave you every emotion you can think of it was that good. The battles were terrific and the story of Frodo and Sam was amazing. Luckily, the movie was 3 hours and 30 minutes, so you have a long while to enjoy it. I wish I could go back."
"This, being the final movie in the trilogy, is also the climax of the story, and what a climax it is. This is just perfection. Sheer perfection. I hope this movie makes it to position 1 on the imdb's top 250, because it really deserves this place. This is unlike anything I have ever seen. It is such a magical movie and you must see it!!! This is truly a milestone in the history of cinema. Go and see it and be a part of movie history...Absolutely fantastic. 10/10"
"Wow what a movie, i mean visually stunning and just plain awesome in every aspect. The Acting was at its best, the f/x were great and the movie it self blew me away. 10/10 no doubt to me. I think this is the year that Lord of the Rings will sweep the Academy Awards."
This gives more than sufficient closure to a timeless epic.  Imagery that is used to protray action from the book is nothing less than remarkable. With intensive dialog and dramatic and appropriate effects the movie is stunning and every minute is filled.  It was well entertaining for both those who read the books and those that have not.
"There's so much to say about this film, but I'm sure someone else has already said it better, so I'll just add my quick opinion.This is quite possibly, the best film I've ever seen in the last couple of years. The original first got me to read the books, and by the 2nd one, I had finished the books. I knew what was going to happen in this one all along, and yet I was still extremely satisfied.I can only say this. If I knew what was going to happen, then I can only imagine that it will be much, much better for those who don't know what happens."
From the time Lord of the Rings was flashed on the screen I was amazed by the entire movie all the way to the end of the Credits. I have seen some movie battles in my day but the battle at Minas Tirith was the greatest. If you are a hardcore Lord of the Rings fan or if you never heard of this movie I would recommend this to everyone. It was that good.
"How explain the complete pleasure of a fan- freak viewing his most desire fulfilled?No words can contain my feelings. This work has come up against a lot of difficulties and put them aside. Jackson and crew took our pounding hearts and our reluctant beliefs and put them to the highest degree. Just pointing that no other movie can make me break and cry for a complete hour makes me realise of what this work has come to be. The more emotive movie for me and the majority of my friends.I can only be uncomfortable with my English expressions, shall them be not clear enough or not gramatically correct, but you can bet on this:The best movie I've seen for years since The Empire Strikes Back.Chapeau, LotR Trilogy cast & crew. CHAPEAU, SUPERB AND IMPRESIONANTE!!"
"Fantastic achievement in film-making!  Surpasses 1 and 2, excellent as they both were (PARTICULARLY in the extended DVD versions, which I now own).  I only wish there could be a FOURTH installment to REALLY wrap up all ""loose"" ends!  (But perhaps release of the extended DVD version in the Fall will help in this regard -- one can hope!)  I feel that BOTH Ian McKellan (Gandalf) and Sean Astin (Samwise) deserve ""Oscar"" attention this year - and OF COURSE Peter Jackson for ""Best Director!""  Have heard persistent rumors that Jackson MAY consider tackling ""The Hobbit"" in another couple of years. Would be wonderful if true!"
"I'll have to come right out and say it.  I have seen quite a few great movies but I went into the movie theatre for this one with the highest of expectations and was not disappointed one bit.  Save for the fact it could have actually been longer, but PJ will be sorting that out for us saddoes with the DVD next year. I know a few people would have had tears in their eyes towards the end but I was actually crying at charge of the Gondorian light brigade.  Never have I seen such a thing of amazing beauty and passion.  I was shaking when I left the cinema. I don't think this movie can be topped."
"Every aspect of the film was at the highest level.  My one major gripe is that it truly dragged on at the end.  In fact, I found myself saying, c'mon let's get this over with.  Regardless, a brilliant conclusion to Jackson's film trilogy."
"So the almost 7 year long trek has ended with an amazing movie.  All things aside not a single movie of a book has ever plodded along with every line in a movie.  Never has one and there never will be.  But a faithful representation of what the meaning is certainly here.  We will never know what type of a movie the author wanted or would have done.  So stop the arguing and just enjoy a fabulous movie, entertaining and so well done. Deserves all of the Academy Awards out there and still will not win. Hollywood is stupid as we know."
"Historical, you do not need to be a fan of the subject. Just look beyond all that to see the writers message to all humankind. This film speaks to us, gives us hope for our lives and for all the world. This film is an Epic for all Time."
"For me, the Lord of the Rings trilogy is the greatest story ever told. Peter Jackson has accomplished a phenomenal achievement by bringing Tolkien's fantasy world into real life characters, living in such beautiful vivid scenes. This last installment of the trilogy is the greatest piece of cinema I ever seen.10 out of 10."
"There aren't many words that can describe this trilogy. It's sublime. Especially the Return to the King. I don't think I have ever seen any movie this good before. My hat goes off to Peter Jackson. The way he has translated the books to the screen is unprecedented. Marvelous.Christmas is not going to be the same anymore. There is no LotR movie to wait for. Thank you to everyone who has participated in this magnificent piece of work.This gets at 10/10 rating. (if I could go higher, I would)"
"I've seen Return of the King, Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday. I was also blessed with the soundtrack. Howard Shore is amazing.  His music for Return of the King cannot be topped. Period.How was acting? All I can say, Sean Astin, Bernard Hill, even John Noble deserves best supporting nomination. As for best Actor, Viggo Mortensen, Ian McKellen.The beauty of this movie is its love for one another. The love was shown at the end of this movie. You won't get any spoliers from me! The sadness portrayed from the gifted actors and actresses on the screen went straight into my heart.  I imagine I will cry once again seeing the movie for the 4th time. -Gia"
"Finally after a year of waiting Return of the King came out and blew me away.  I was expecting, once again, brilliant fighting scenes to go along with the story.  I received this along with emotional scenes which gave me the goosebumps and nearly brought tears to my eyes. This movie was a fantastic finale to the trilogy and should go down as the years best film."
"I remember when I was a little boy and my father took me to the cinema seeing ""Empire strikes back"".... I thought I would never experience these feelings in my life again. But here and today it happened and I still can´t believe it. Peter Jackson has done the unbelievable and brought images and emotions on the screen far beyond expectations. ""Return of the King"" is THE epic masterpiece of our time, maybe of every time."
"Not many movies can make a movie proud when coming from a book, but this is an exception. It has power and beauty throughout the movie. The acting is breathtaking. The amount of emotion within this movie is more than combining all the current movies out."
This was absolutely great ending for the story (as like I didn't know how it ends). I agree with local critics that even as lasting almost three and a half hours this movie is not complete. I really look forward to see the extended edition that will fulfill this movie experience :)
"Fantastic! Brilliant!Mr. Jackson... well done!The Fellowship of the Ring was a great movie! The Two Towers was good, but I still liked the first a little better. The third and final installment was simply mindblowing!I can hardly wait for the extended length DVD!"
"The film is absolutely breathtaking and enthralling from start to finish. You would never believe that you have been sat in a cinema for over three hours when it ends, the time just disappears.If this film does not carry all before it at the Oscars then there really is no justice on this earth."
"That was the best movie I have seen in my whole entire life. Beats Gone with the Wind. I cried, and I laughed, and I got p*ssed at Gollum and the Steward of Gondor. The acting was fabulous. SEan Astin's portrayl as Sam was awesome~ Sam was truly a hero in this movie, no doubt. Best movie ever. period."
"I went into this movie with high expectations.And they were more than met...
This movie is,simply put,perfect.I loved each and every minute of it.And no,I was not disappointed or displeased with the ending at all.Like I said,it's perfect.For the following reasons--1) Acting.This movie is an acting phenomenon.Never have I seen more power put into the performances of films than these.Elijah Wood,Sean Astin,Viggo Mortensen,Ian McKellen,Dominic Monoghan (sp?),Billy Boyd,Liv Tyler,Miranda Otto,Andy Serkis,and all the rest of the cast are all spectacular performers,and should all be given special nods.2) Beauty.This movie is beautiful.Whether it be with the scenery,or the cloud patterns in the sky that reveal a beautiful sunshine over the Pelennor Fields,this movie is pure beauty.Never has a movie been so utterly amazing with its scenery and sheer spectacle.3) Effects.But,of course!You already know how good/perfect they are!4)Action sequences.Simply AMAZING.Never have I been amazed by such grandeur in action than in these films.The Battle of the Pelennor fields was a perfect treat.One special moment in this battle is the charge of the Rohirrim.The sheer beauty of this scene evokes such emotion that can only be met by these films.5)Musical Score.Howard Shore is the best music composer that has ever lived.His triumphant score proves that.The soundtracks of these movies are perfection.6)Everything else you want to name.Script,cinematography,sound,the faithfulness to Tolkien's classic masterpiece,and everything.Perfect.Just perfect.I truly believe these movies are going to live on in history as the greatest film achievements of all time.10/10?No.10 is too low a number.
1000000000000000/10"
"I had very high hopes for this one, and was not disappointed.  There were touch points I had visualized (the Cracks of Mount Doom, the Grey Havens) and they were done with exquisite beauty.  What is amazing to me is that PJ can forge the tale onscreen with the SFX and majesty of overwhelming scope and power, while at the same time present Sam's sacrifice and the pain of Frodo with heart-rending humanity.Hats off to the best trilogy of all time."
"I really don't think there is any word I could choose that would best describe the finale for LOTR trilogy, except that it was the most spectacular piece of filmmaking i've ever seen. Granted i'm only 27 years old, and i've seen my fair share of exciting, and adventureous movies. But this takes the cake by far. Granted i'm no expert the film industry(as much as I want to be someday), but to be moved through so many emotions in one film. That in my book denotes filmmaking at its finest. I laughed, cheered,and as many others... cried. It was one of the most intense emotional roller coaster rides through a film i've ever seen. Of course there are a lot of people out there who will pick this movie apart. A lot of whom have read the books and will say it didn't live up to its true potential. Me... I haven't had a chance to read the books yet, but from what I hear from most of my friends is that it does live up to the way the books are portrayed. I personally think that Peter Jackson's imagination of it all was above and beyond what everyone expected. During the three years of this epic adventure, I feel as if I have lived every single minute of it. And I wouldn't take that feeling back for anything. Long live the King ( and Hobbits)"
"... as in five stars for Peter Jackson's latest installment in the Lord of the Rings ""trilogy"". What a spectacular film! Visually stunning and breathtaking action sequences. The scriptwriters remain mostly faithful this time around to the source material. My main concern lies with the decision that was made to omit (in the theatrical version) the fate of Saruman and Wormtongue (the latest was such an interesting character in the second movie and was underused in the films).I certainly look forward to the extended edition set!"
"""Return of the King"" proves conclusively that magic still exists in the world of filmmaking. Not only does this film ""crown"" Peter Jackson's incredible achievement, it does so in a way no sequel ever has, or likely ever will again. The perfect blend of director, screenwriters, production designers, and incomparable performances make this last installment something akin to Beethoven's 9th Symphony: a spirit inhabits the whole trilogy and it rises above the medium of the screen and takes us to places films seldom do.Thank God Hollywood didn't have its hands on this masterpiece.The only thing left now is for PJ and his colleagues to receive Oscars that are 3 times the normal size."
"This is the best movie I have ever seen.  I left the theater on a adrenaline high, not knowing what emotion I should feel.I couldn't keep track of how many times my emotions went from sky high to the bottom of the bucket or visa versa in a matter of moments.  Not a movie for kids, but not one for any adult to miss.  One piece of advice, though; use the restroom first-there's no point in the movie that's slow enough to miss!!!"
"I would call myself avid movie patron and thus have seen my fare share of movies. I have never in all my life seen a movie to where I was moved to tears never the less throughout the entire film. Each seen kept getting more powerful and no matter how hard I fought back it couldn't stop the pure joy and admiration I felt. Thank you Peter Jackson and Mr. Tolkien, today i was honored and priviledged with the opportunity to see that film. Thank you."
"well I guess Tolkien did it right first. Other directors/filmmakers should take note. This is a reason to make a trilogy, a story arc that is told over three films.  In addition to enjoying the acting, the story, and the visual, the moviegoer gets to experience a personal sense of completion; after investing part of the last three years of our lives in this series..we have personally reached the end, as have the characters in the film.I found the picture to be very moving.  And I dont really understand all the talk about multiple endings; there is only one ending..when the words THE END appear. There are a lot of stories here, and each deserves some sense of closure (including the ones that will have to wait for DVD).We should all have a friend like Sam...in a lot of ways he was the spirit of this film, and it appropriately ended with him"
"I never thought I'd give a 10, let alone to such a big-spectacle type film, but I'm happy to make an exception for ROTK. Thank you, Peter Jackson, for the gift of this trilogy. Never as an adult have I been immersed in a film experience before. I thought I'd lost that ability after ""Star Wars"". I now hand the reins of my favorite all time film to ROTK, and my favorite film trilogy to LOTR. I had high hopes for the SW prequels to bring an adult sensibility and modern sophistication to what was the best film series of all time. Who'd have thought it would be Peter Jackson and LOTR? The only downside to ROTK? It hurts to say goodbye to these remarkable characters and creations."
"I have not read any of these books so I began this movie saga with some knowlege of the stories. In the first one I met the charicters and was drawn in to their lives and couldn't wait to see what came next. I was disapointed with the second and had reservations about the third thinking all the punch of these movies may of been thrown in the first round. The mistakes made during the second were learned from and were no were to be found in this film. Some of the plot twists that dragged my attention away from the movie in the second one were in this movie but done with much more skill and hidden under a story that kept me guessing. The action was fantastic and held my ""just enjoy the moivie"" gene not letting my mind stray on things that didn't seem right. Yes this saga began with a flury was paced with jabs in the middle and delivers a knockout in the end."
"an absolutely fabulous film, which brings a brilliant trilogy to a perfect conclusion. the actors/actresses in the film play their parts perfectly, the score is perfect as always, the scenery and detail in the film is second to none and the action is utterly amazing.if you don't go to see this film, you really must be mad. the only sad thing is that there is no 4th film. hats off to Peter Jackson and his crew, for making a masterpiece of cinema history!!!"
"IT had some stunning sequences, but the movie was entirely too long. They could cut out some of the weeping stuff in the end. Plus, a lot of the main characters are really one-dimensional and the dialogue scense are sorta cheesy.this is my humble opinion.no way, do these films top Star Wars or the Godfather"
"One would think, with all the praise, all the books & the first two movies, I would be prepared for the final installment of the Lord. But no! Like all movies, it's not perfect: too long of course! Especially the first act. It seemed like it's designed for people without knowledge of the first two films, but once it get's going, wow! Acts two & three are probably the most brilliant, greatest & most satisfying of my movie going life & I'm nearly 49 yrs. old! And not only should it get the Best Picture Award, but Sean Astin should get best actor, too. A simply brilliant job of acting in the single brightest film yet made."
"Having recently watched the third installment of the Matrix, (and been bitterly disappointed) I needed something to lift my spirits. my expectations were exceptionally high. I had thought that the first Lotr was fantastic, an 8.9 rating in my book, the second installment was infinitely better, and i would have given it a 9.5.This movie, however,  cannot be rated on any given scale. never had I been so easily manipulated by a film, regardless of how good it was. Rotk did that to me and more. i was engulfed in middle earth and its lore. i cheered and celebrated, i loved every moment, and was completely detached from the real world for the entire duration of the movie and for the evening afterwards. never had i been ""drunk"" from a film, and it was a an experience to remember.Many have noted that the movie slightly departs from the book. and that is true. but a complete rendition of the Lotr would never have been innovative, and would have a soul-less feel. Peter Jackson has given us his vision, and it is one that i thoroughly enjoyed.Mr. Jackson, if you win an academy award for this film, (and you should), don't bother thanking anyone. we should all thank you for giving us a reason to watch movies again. nothing will ever compare to this brilliant gem.
for those of you who would undermine this movie: good luck; your words will fall on deaf ears."
"This movie ""is"" the best of the Trilogy.  I've read the books twice and even with the changes, I think this film is the BEST film I've ever seen in my life.  Now maybe I'm feeling this way because I'm still pumped-up from seeing it.  The feeling that it leaves you with is unforgettable. I want to see it again and again, and again.  It really is that good!  Tolkien would be proud."
"Never have I been so sad when a movie ends, not because the movie was sad but because I will never get to experience anymore of the characters I have grown to love over the past 3 years.  I won't say that this movie is flawless, but I will say that the first 3 hours were the best 3 hours of film contained in one movie that I have ever seen. People who dislike the first 2 movies because they deviated from Tokien's original storyline will not like this movie either, but that wasn't a concern for me despite having read the series 7 times.  I love the books in a different way, but Jackson's interpretation is almost as I'd envisioned Middle Earth.  It is a shame the story had to end."
"Great!!! ""SET"" of Movies!!! I would say for the good and the bad comments the undertaking of the producers and Director to create a spectacular set of 3 seemless like films is more than we have seen in movie making in years... This Series has opened us up to new and wonderful futures in film making!!!"
"Peter Jackson did a very good job with the first two movies, although some of the liberties he took were hard to accept.  However, with Return of the King, Jackson took the characters and storylines and made them shine!  If this movie does not win Oscars, it does not say anything about the film's quality, but rather the quality of the Oscars.  An exceptional end to an amazing trilogy!"
"I could go on about the awesome scope of the battles, but why bother?  I could  gush about some incredible performances, but why bother?  I could mention all the moments when I wanted to cheer, shout, cry, but you've heard it already, so why bother?  I could quibble about the ending, Saruman's absence, any of the tiny flaws, but why bother?Simply put, movies don't get much better than this.  Give 'em the trophy!"
"I don't normally fall for hype, but I felt ROTK was an amazing end to an amazing trilogy of films.  I'm not interested in what the book purists have to say, all I see is a beautiful crafted film(s) that catch the imagination of the most bland of people!The only comment I have is that it was far too mushy for my liking at the end - I would have liked to see all that nonsence out and the original sacking replaced...  At one point I thought Sam and Frodo were going to have a snog..  Scary thought!  Ah well, at least sam was a less camp sort of gay... Unlike the previous efforts to represent him...Enjoy!"
"Simply the greatest movie ever made.  I've been a fan of the books since childhood and although my hopes for this series were high, my expectations were disappointment.  Peter Jackson and the entire cast and crew delivered more than I imagined possible.  They really brought the books to life, and even the few plot changes went over well with me.  I can't wait for the extended edition of this one!  Meantime, I'm heading back to see it in the theater as many times as possible."
"Ok, first and foremost this film is brilliant, epic, emotional. There are not many films around where I would say such things because it would be over the top. I think what sets this film apart is the fact that it was based on such a solid foundation;Tolkien's book was itself a fantastic piece of literature. The action to detail and the characterisation are just superb, this is not a film were the characters are second to the action, which itself is brilliant, instead it is a mixture of the both, the characterisation and the detail to the characters exemplifies the action because you actually care about the characters. I cannot recommend it high enough, just go to you local cinema and watch it, I'm sure you'll love it.."
"I saw this and my perspective on cinema has changed. This is by far the most respectful and greatly done movie. Number 1 of all time, all the way. I remember when it all began, and seeing this conclusion it has been one heck of a ride."
The bones of Tolkien's vision made flesh! When I first read this wonderful tale over 30 years ago my vivid imagination could not have bettered this depiction in film!  To say that this movie is 'true to the book' is indeed a complement..and it is!  Well done!
"Hmm, Firstly the movie was out of this world. Peter Jackson has indeed shown his mettle one final time. The adventure of middle earth as we know it on screen has come to an end.But what an end it turned out to be. If the first two were amazing, this one is magnificent. Anything one says or writes will just not be enough for this film. Middle Earth comes alive yet once again in our imagination through the lenses of Jackson. deserves an oscar definitely, and will prevail as one of the best made movies of all times, and I am really proud to say that I consider myself lucky that I got to see this in my lifetime. The movie will be etched in the minds of our generation till the end of our lives. Hope the world feels the same."
"Was that movie 3.5 hours?  I didn't even notice.Peter Jackson not only successfully brought the Rings Trilogy to the screen, he put together three movies in such a way that all future directors should take note.King offered the complete development of all the LOTR characters, without compromising the integrity of the books, and without losing the audience in the process.  Middle Earth was entrusted to Mr. Jackson and he delivered perfectly!  The placement of comic relief was PERFECT.  And he presented all the loyalty, action, drama and romance, while still retaining the underlying dark and insidious spirit that prevailed in all three movies.Three Cheers for the Three Ring Movies.  The greatest trilogy of movies ever presented.  Bar none.  This, even more so than the first two, is Oscar worthy material all around."
"This movie u must see!!!,  it incorporates just about everything that a person could want in a movie.  Its an Emotional roller coaster of action, suspense,and a huge range of emotions.  Awesome acting, a great end to a wonderful trilogy.  This is a MUST SEE.  So stop reading this review and go watch it!!!!"
"Wow.Wow.The coolest film I've seen in a very long time.  I would simply descend into babbling fanboy territory if I started to discuss just what makes this film the icing on the cake of the finest film trilogy ever (yes, it's better than Star Wars).  Suffice to say that if you don't go and watch The Return of the King at the earliest available opportunity, you will be missing out in a very big way indeed.  But I'm betting you already knew that.Beautiful in every way."
I saw the LORT Trilogy on Trilogy Tuesday.  It was a great experience to wach all three films in the theatre in order.  Plus i got to see the ROTK before it opened nationwide.  This was one of the best acting that i have seen from a cast of great actors especially Elijah Wood & Sean Astin.
"Great movie to end this trilogy. It cannot be better... except if it was longer to include more and more of the books. Even in my dreams, I never hope such an adaptation. Peter Jackson and all the others have made something really outstanding."
"Saw an advance screening last night. It's hard to put into words all the reasons why I loved this film. As a fan of the Tolkien, I can't believe how well Peter Jackson did these movies. This movie by itself was the best movie I've ever seen, and it makes the entire trilogy a timeless masterpiece.Without spoiling you, Peter Jackson stays true to the book. The acting, cinematography, costumes, plot, gollum, creatures, etc etc are all superb. If you enjoyed the previous films, you will definitely not be disappointed. The acting/emotions between Sam, Frodo and Gollum are intense. Merry and Pippin are believable heroes. A huge thank you to all the actors and production people in making such an incredible film. I can't wait to see it again."
There are no words to describe how truly magnificent this film is as a film itself and as a conclusion to this masterwork of a trilogy. I defy anyone to not feel sad at its end amongst the joy of its brilliance. It even stands up to the harsh criticism of me as a lover of the books. Bravo Peter Jackson and New Line!
"I just saw this movie last night and it was absolutely awesome! The way they pulled everything together and its great resemblance to the book makes it all the better...... This movie should hands down win Movie of the year. The landscape will yet again blow u away as this movie features Minus Tirus and Mtn. pics.This movie is alot more violent which means alot more mighty fighting from Legolas, Gimli and Arragorn, Everything about this movie is amazing.... if u dont see it in theaters than it willl be the biggest thing u will have ever missed out on."
"Amazing special effects. Allthough the story misses some detaills compared to J.R.R. Tolkiens book Lord of the Rings, you'll not be disappointed! More then 3 hours of high end spectakel, breathtaking effects and Peter Jackson even put more storyline into the film characters!Start the movie, and experiences the richdom of CGI!"
"After returning from the midnight premier at 4AM, I am really looking forward to seeing the extended edition DVD. This was worth the wait. I don't think Tolkien fans will be disappointed. It is nice to see a film good enough to cheer for."
"If you haven't seen this movie yet, you're all in for a hell of a treat. Words are inadequate to convey the range of emotions I have just experienced while watching this masterpiece of cinema. If this movie doesn't earn best picture at the academy awards then a grave injustice will have been committed."
"This is a masterpiece, Gondor will prosper for a thousand years.  The old world is passing away, the age of man is beginning.Peter Jackson is a genius!Sean Astin deserves an Oscar.  Ian McKellan deserves an Oscar.  Viggo Mortenson deserves an Oscar.  The Return of the King is the Best Drama of the Year!It has been a very long wait, everyone said that LOTR was not filmable. Well Peter Jackson has done the impossible."
"...but the ending of the book was completely skipped, along with several important parts of the book.  Everything it did cover though was perfect. I really, really wish they had filmed the end of the book though so it could at least be in the DVD."
"Without a doubt, the best, grandest, largest and most enthralling epic of all time. Do whatever it takes to see this film. The story is great, the production is amazing, the special-effects are beyond all imagination and well, after this, everything is going to be an anti-climax."
"Went to ""Trilogy Tuesday""...ROTK was terrific.  Peter Jackson stays true to the book this time around, only leaving out parts rather than changing plot lines (i.e. Faramir in Two Towers).  After watching the first two movies in the hours before, I didn't expect to be as awed by the majesty and grandeur of the locations and effects as I was when I saw ""Fellowship"".  Instead, I found myself holding my breath in amazement.  The acting again is strong and provides strong drama to compliment the myriad of action sequences in the movie.  You'll be cheering or laughing in one moment and then holding back tears in the next. A well done finale to one of the greatest movie series of all time."
"Just came back from the 12:10AM showing of Return of the King and I was very impressed.  I gave it a 9 out of 10 because the music score didn't quite seem as well as the 1st movie, everything else was excellent.  I can't believe its all over now, I guess have to find something else to obsess about."
"First off, I'd like to say that this is the best movie out of the trilogy, and throughout the whole movie I was on the edge of my seat, full of emotions that Peter Jackson wanted me to feel.It's truly amazing how well The Return of the King stayed true to the novel, much more so than I had expected. True, they cut out a few important scenes, which will remain nameless in the honor of no spoilers, but I'm sure these scenes will be added on in the Extended Edition (reserve me my Lord of the Rings Trilogy Extended Edition DVD!).Disregarding those minor exclusions, Peter Jackson's genius shone in the last installment. Never once did I feel like the movie was dragging; in fact I wished the movie to continue - it even felt a bit rushed to me. Never did I cringe at the emotional scenes, or question the intense battle scenes. I felt like I was truly watching not only a great movie, but Jackson really made me feel like I was watching an earlier version of the world, which the great J.R.R. Tolkein had conjured. Being fully immersed in a film is a moniker of a wonderful movie, which LotR:RotK is.10 out of 10, and many thanks to the crew of the Lord of the Rings. You've given me hours of delightful entertainment, well worth my $8 movie ticket."
"Well the battle for middle earth is over, and it was worth the wait. LOTR: Return of the King, is the best movie of the series. Everything that made the first one great, and the second one great, was incorporated into one epic event. The story telling of the first one combined with some the sickest battles ever, combine to make one of the best movies of our generation."
"I was very well indulged by the movie preparedness on how it leads the ""final"" battle for middle earth. Some parts of the movie I did not expect. This is different from the previous two where I could sorta guess what was going to happen next. in my option this ""Edge-of-the-seat-goodness"" really is true. You must see this. Top movie for sure! 11 out of 10 stars (if I could vote that). :)Good job Peter Jackson!!!"
"... well, maybe not. BUT certainly the most immersive movie big budget, special effects film created so far. And definitely the best third installment ever made. This is a new type of film, a new experience, a turning point for the use of special effects in film.Look out, Oscars, the king has returned..."
"Very, very big and mighty, the battle in Minas Tirith is an awesome scene. Although i miss some scenes, Gandalf's meeting with Saruman etc. Some unnecessary scenes should have been removed and replaced with scenes such as the one i mentioned.Overall a great movie and a worthy end of the trilogy."
"16 December, 23.59. We are waiting...00.00, the 17th of December has come. The Netherlands sees The Return of the King. And it was superb! Some remarks perhaps about the end and some not included pieces of the book, like the house of the healing, the mouth of Sauron, but it was worth it being there until this early moment."
"Huh! Where would I start.. The beginning of the film was very interesting because it told the story behind (cute) Smeagol. You surely get the feeling that this film is going to be brilliant, and it really is. Althought it's over three hours long,you don't get tired of it, because there is something happening all the time.The casting is awesome. There are none of bad casting, and just some to mention Viggo Mortensen and Elijah Wood are brilliant. Everything is so credible that after movie it feels that you live in some kind of seventh heaven.This is the greatest movie of all, and you all must see it! 5+/5"
"I was fortunate to see this film at the press-screening and it didn't let me down one bit.An overlong running time, filled with action, suspense, drama and one of the greatest battle-sequences ever filmed. It's a safe bet, that if you liked the first two installments, you'll like that one as well.Technically, it's top notch! Where the second one was a bit rough around the edges (especially the Warg-Riders, this one is a big step forward. Gollum has even more punch this time around!LORD OF THE RINGS is now completed and here to stay. One of the greatest books turned into one of the greatest films and there will be generations benefiting from the pure imagination both of them delivered so deliberately.Hollywood, please take note, that in these dark times, we need films with heart and passion to get us through. LORD OF THE RINGS is the best example of how this is achieved."
"Thank you, Barrie Osborne, for bringing the movie to Carleton College.Wow, what risks they took -- and the controversies surrounding them.  Yes, individual parts make you wonder whether it will ever work, but it does. It's simple and beautiful, and all my fears were for nothing.
Even with the books fully in mind, there are moments of genuine suspense.Some of the moments of high emotion lacked the subtle touch that I appreciated so much in the first movie, but that did not dampen my enjoyment."
"The critique that Saruman was noticeably absent is accurate.  The critique that the ending went on a bit too long is accurate.  The critique that the score was unoriginal is accurate (however it does provide continuity with the previous movies-as it should).HOWEVER - those critiques are in the deep shadows of this brilliant final film.  Overwhelming is perhaps the best adjective for this.
Jackson demonstrates not only great direction, but incredible vision, and huge cajones.  It will be a long time (maybe never) before anyone tries anything as ambitious as this and not only pulls it off but does so spectacularly.  If they ever run all three movies together, I'll buy a seat cushion and be first in line."
"The story was ruined, the ending was drawn-out, the whole movie was shot in this ridiculous - this story is so epic I will pan around and everything will seem really dramatic, even when there is no real action - way. It was like a parody of itself, I can hardly believe people could find any of the worth of the novels in this self-aggrandizing trilogy. I only paid $3 to see this film and was wishing for my money back. After what should've been the final scene of the movie there was this fake 10 minute ending where thousands of people simply cheered on screen. It was such a blatant way of telling people the fabulous movie, the tremendous trilogy is over let's all celebrate. It was terrible."
"I don't wish to offend any one but to protect the integrity of the rating system. Honestly, if you enjoyed the film it was more because you read the books and have been avid about the story for a few decades than it was its cinematic quality. I'm sure it was wonderful for what it was, but people- was it really the second best movie ever released? Saying that The Return of the King was of better quality than Network, Dr. Strange Love- or any of the greats is naive. It's story is not its, so if you voted so highly for its story than you were voting for the book. Visually: impressive, but think about the pictures budget. So what was it than, it was unoriginal- and certainly not worthy of second best film on IMDb."
I hate when peoples don`t ever use advisors (e.g. Battle Orders) All the moneys gone to FX. And no one cares if battles looks just stupid... If you knows at least how the Bow works....
"From beginning to end I can sum this film up in two words, mindless dribble. It took me till the last scene of the film to realize that almost every scene in both The Two Towers and Return Of The King had been tragged on for much longer than it should have done, scenes that should take 2 minutes to watch take 10 minutes, in most scenes it consists of slow motion movement, special effects, and soft meaningless music. I couldn't believe the last 30 minutes of the film, I was actually thinking to myself what am I watching. I believe LOTR trilogy to be no different from the Matrix trilogy, a good start to a story but then in the sequels both films were packed jammed full of special effects, supposedly they thought that if they shoved enough special effects in that in would breath take the audience and maybe they wouldn't think too much about the story. I truly feel embarrassed for the people that have rated this movie in the same league as such real epics as Braveheart, Titanic, Terminator 2 etc. This may bring great controversy and I look forward to hearing your reply's. Feel free to contact me through my email address with your views."
"This movie is so damn boring. One of if not the worst film ever made. Give me a real movie with real actors with a producer with real talent. These movies made me want to throw up they were so horrible, don't waste your 3 hours watching this movie it's not worth it there's better ways to spend your time. Did anyone really believe that green thing that can't even talk. It was like that stupid Jar-Jar character they put on Star Wars. Now if you want to see a movie with action and adventure with better writing then go watch Face/Off don't waste a minute of your time on this movie. Please, who ever voted and made this movie #3 where it doesn't belong it should be along the lines of worst movie ever. I rather watch From Justin To Kelly a billion times then waste my time watching a movie like this."
"I don't know what the Academy was thinking when it gave The Return of the King those 11 awards.  It did not deserve a single one, especially best picture.  Lost in Translation, Mystic River, Cold Mountain, and even Seabiscuit were all far better.  Those films actually had depth and meaning where as the Lord of the Rings is just like Titanic; a bunch of shotty acting and film making covered up with tons of high budget special effects. Neither film deserved their awards and both in my view, are among the most overrated, and crappiest films in history. I wish the academy would stop choosing the films that are the most popular or will give them the greatest approval rating."
"The worst of the three parts, and one of the most overrated films in the history. Peter Jackson spends a lot of time with no sense battles in a three hour film that can't finish all the plots of the Trilogy. The film includes very horrible scenes like one with one horse rider who kills an giant elephant only with his sword, and one when the floor falls down in all the ways except where the heroes are standing. A good film for those who like the FX more than the script, and for the video games programmers, and a awful movie for those who loved The Fellowship of the ring, the first film of the PJ's personal vision about The Lord of The Ring"
"All film sequels/trilogies should be made like The Lord of the Rings Trilogy was made, aka at the same time. I think that if a movie is destined to have a sequel, like LOTR since it was based on an already existing trilogy, it should be made at the same time as the original. The reason for my opinion on this is because I believe that having the original cast in a sequel, is a really important factor in a successful sequel. I mean even in animation, if u don't have the same voices as the original, then it isn't the same, and the movie practically fails just because that. I mean who wants to go see a movie that is a sequel to a popular movie with a cast who doesn't know how to act like the audience likes them to act, aka like in the original. All in all people don't want to see different actors/actresses replacing their favorite characters good or bad as they may be."
"By capturing the spirit of Tolkien's sweeping epic, previously considered ""unfilmable"", Peter Jackson produced a masterpiece beyond the powers of any other living director. This finale of the Lord of the Rings, especially in its extended DVD edition, interprets the book with astonishing detail, devotion, and delicacy. It fully deserves its clean-sweep of 11 Oscars. The production culture at Jackson's ""Wellywood"" studios represented something new for Hollywood. By empowering lovers of the film's source material, Jackson accepted the contributions of artists, sculptors, set designers, technicians, and actors who helped develop an organic approach to the film-making process. Jackson, although clear in his vision of the movie, proved himself the ultimate collaborator. By drawing together hundreds of talented individuals, he secured a quality of production previously unseen in regular studio settings where movie executives usually police the creative process. New Line are to be congratulated for taking a huge gamble that has given the world such a priceless legacy. Jackson is a genius and the love invested in Tolkien's work shines throughout the movie trilogy."
"I am a fan of Tolkien and his works,and I am a fantasy writer myself. I started reading the books after watching the trilogy,FOTR was excellent and adventurous,TTT was full of action,and ROTK the final installment was a combination of the two and a glimpse of Braveheart. ROTK captured Tolkien's imagination,the city of Minas Tirith is it is as it was,the battles were majestic and medieval,the story is and soundtrack kept my heart pounding.This film inspired me,this film is filled with wonder and awe,it is the best fantasy film of the 21st century and will be remembered as one. I hope that there will be film versions of the Silmarillion soon and other prequels of LOTR."
"I would just like to say that Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King is the best movie ever made. There are a lot of other pretty darn good movies out there, but don't compare to Return of the King. Star Wars is the closest movie that comes to Lord of the Rings. I would also like to say that the love connection between Aragorn and Arwen IS in the books. Look it up in the Appendices 2, it in fact has every line that has to do with Aragorn and Arwen in the movie. You people who just heard rumors of the love connection being fake decided to skim over the books and not READ it all. That is all I have to say about that. Thank You. 10 out of 10(the movie)"
"The Lord of the Rings, in my opinion are the best films ever made, and nothing comes close to them .The acting is beautiful , the scenery is magnificent. The directing is full of passion and love. Altogether this has made 3 wonderful movies. They have so many levels, so many depths,full of magic, journeys of love, friendship and leading to the compassion and good of a fellowship of men defeating the evil powers of middle earth. They will make you laugh,smile and cry.Altogether they truly are such powerful and enchanting movies. I am so glad that the entire team got the recognition and applause they deserved, for they truly are the most magnificent movies."
"This is the final installment of the best Trilogy that I have ever seen. I love all of the Rings movies and I love this one just as much. Everything about this movie is great. Great costumes, acting, story, scenery, CG, everything. I really am not a fan of fantasy, actually I do whatever I can to stay away from it. Ever since I saw the first LOTR movie I was hooked. Actually I can say I like this LOTR movie the last since it is the last. I really didn't want this story to end. Personally, I can only find one thing in the movie that I didn't care for and that would be the people, for lack of a better term (I don't like to give away anything in my reviews), Aragorn recruits to assist him. Other than that I really love everything about this movie. Also, I am a huge fan of battle scenes and this movie had the best battle scene I have seen since the Helms Deep scene in the 2nd movie. Peter Jackson has earned a fan for life since I had seen this movie. I realize that nothing else he does will ever compare to the trilogy, but maybe just maybe something will come close. When comparing movies to this movie, even if it is only half as good, it is still twice as good as most films. Classic film! In my top 10 ever."
"To all those who did not 'get' this film. I'm not going to preach to you about how wrong you are, your opinion is your opinion. I'll say this though, We who liked the film saw the same thing that we saw in the book, and that is pure escapism for a small amount of time into a place where things are right are wrong, where we see people and characters that we want to aspire to be like for there ideals and nobility, we see these things because well in these times we find them less and less in the real world around us. Is that just plain geeky? Well there are a whole lot of us out there.Are we all wrong? But hey thats just my interpretation."
"Where it is not the worst of the three (TTT was), it is still a very boring movie, the script has not an ounce of intelligence or grace or excitement. Art design and cinematography are excellent, as were in the previous two installments. The director is missing -probably giving interviews-, there is no sense of plot or purpose. The acting is so bad all across the cast that, to my total surprise, Liv Tyler does not seem the worse of the lot.An unworthy movie."
"Peter Jackson said in interview that the movie he really wanted to make (of the 3) was ROTK -because there was no character development to deal with. Well, it shows.   While there are a few bright moments, they are far between.   Yes, there are spectacles to witness- but vast portions of the film feel pointless -and worse- boring.Jackson demonstrates why you should storyboard AND script a film before starting principle photography- which was not the case here.   The only thing saving a weak script are excellent actors and a high production level. I would have rather seen a low budget film with the same actors and a script that equaled them.At best it is eye candy with characters that have earned endearment from the previous episodes; at worst, ROTK debases what came before by repetition without added substance."
"This movie is not great its barley border-line good. The only two reason I cant think this was rated so high was the extremely high budget on 3D-animation and the fact that people are so easily enticed by the name and actors.Now I am not insulting the books as I have never read them. But other than what I stated what makes this movie so ""great""?Is it the acting? I don't really think Orlando Bloom can preform any other role (take a look at both The Lord Of the Rings and Pirates of the Caribbean)Is it Climax? I think even the people who didn't even read the book knew that from the first half of the first movie knew that the ring would be destroyedIs it the Characters? It had all the basic characters for all movie storyline the only entertaining and not bland character was GolemWhat is it that makes you think its in the league with Schindler's List and CasablancaI don't claim to know what the best movie ever is but i know this movie dose not rank high in greatness it only high in its budget."
"What an over-rated pile of toss! OOoooooooooh look at the effects! Oooooooh Gollum is so real! Ooooooooooh I'd love to have long blond hair and pointy ears! SHUT UP YOU FOOLS!!!!!! Why can't people just watch excellent films and appreciate them instead of being tossed around by the wild current of sensationalism and hype. All three of the films were, at best, average adaptations of the book but just because this is the last one, it gets the highest rating. It's a travesty that rubbish like this overtakes actual classic films on an otherwise excellent database. And don't get me started on Star Wars. This is fantastic nonsense. Over produced and under thought. Bad Taste is a far superior film. Stick with Schlock horror Jackson...and learn how to tie a tie!"
"A think this is a great epic Movie.Its cannot be better!Great job to Peter Jackson and his crow! And afars,thanks to J.R.R Tolkien to great Book.I read now his new Book ""Hurins Children"".Its would bee great to see this movie directed by Peter Jackson.I cannot wait to see a Hobbit.I read the and its fantastic.I ask me,who should bee a Director of ""Hobbit""?But let get to the case,The Lord of the Rings its the best Movie on all the Time.The box office of this film is Impressive! !1,180,000.000$Thats tel that this Movie have fans from whole World,and thats great.And not forget 11 Oscars.And the:One Ring to rule them all.One Ring ti find them,One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them."
"Minus the special effects there is nothing redeeming about this movie. The characters are one dimensional. The story lines (of which there are several) are predictable and uninteresting. The ending is far far far too long and completely unnecessary. Even the way this movie is filmed isn't particularly interesting. Every third shot seemed like a pull away crane shot or an aerial computer generated fly by. The film did do a good job of wrapping up the trilogy, but otherwise I was unimpressed with this movie and the other two for that matter.What really bothers me is that contemporary movies, especially science fiction movies get rated so highly on this site. There is no way this movie is better than Casablanca or La Dolce Vita. Yes, I would say it was mildly entertaining for a popcorn movie, but at 3 hours it was just too much."
"If this is the 2nd best movie of all time, then I must have been taking crazy pills when I saw it. It was perfectly serviceable as a kid's story and the visuals were superb. But the last 35 minutes were a complete waste of everyone's time and all of the acting was mediocre at best. Viggo Mortenson probably deserves some credit for giving the only performance that doesn't stray off into melodrama or rote, wooden ""mailing it in"". I saw the first film in the theaters and nearly fell asleep. I saw the second leg in a drinking theater and was mildly entertained. (The beer helped, a lot.) I saw the 3rd one in the comfort of my own home and had to pause for naps twice. Maybe the sheer grandeur of the CGI-fest would have grabbed me more in a theater setting, but nothing could make up for this plodding, predictable plot."
"This movie was by far the worst of the trilogy in my humble opinion. Bad acting throughout by the majority of the cast, especially Elijah Wood and Sean Astin, made their scenes near intolerable to watch. The script might as well have been nonexistent, as every line was cliched melodramatic crap. Finally, my biggest pet peeve of the film, the last 30 minutes or so of this movie is painfully hard to watch. Not because the viewer is being challenged, like in 'The Passion', but because I nearly fell asleep because it was so boring. 11 Oscars? Please. That only proves one thing. The Oscars are no longer an important award that stands above the rest of the crappy hundreds of awards show that are out the now, but rather, they are just another one of these bland, repetitive, mass appeal shows that are just there so everybody can see what their favorite star or most hated stars will look like. 5/10"
"After the glory of the first film, and the almost-glory of the second, I was expecting better from this film than Peter Jackson delivered.Up until now he had been fairly true to the storyline.  Not so with this film.  I won't spoil it for those who haven't read the book and/or seen the film, but all I will say is that the ending to this film is, shall we say, different.A three hour film is fair enough, and I can happilly sit through one. Except when the last half hour or so is as bad as this one.  It could so easilly have been cut down to a reasonable length, just by following the plot.  Instead Mr Jackson, in his wisdom, decided it would be good to change the ending completely and extend it by about 30 minutes.I was on the verge of walking out it got so boring to the end.A bit of a disappointment really.  Such a shame as he started out so well with the other two parts."
"After producing what seemed to me something of a masterpiece (FOTR) and a very, very, good film (TTT), containing what I consider one of cinema's great moments in the battle for Helms Deep, the trilogy seems to me to finish with merely a good film. I consider ROTK weaker than the previous two in almost every aspect, with the main problems: patchy special effects, which go from absolutely brilliant to laughable, constant intercutting between story lines that destroys any sense of momentum and engagement (though it would have been difficult to do it any other way given the nature of the book), a poor score (in stark contrast to the others) and the curse of the sequel ""you've seen it all before"". All this being said it is still an enjoyable, if rather long film, and the overall trilogy is an incredible achievement for Jackson and his team."
"Extra ordinary movie. Believe it or not, i watched this movie over 50 times. If you love fantasy, war, history genre, then you must see it. What a story, what a graphics!! i just can't describe. Soundtrack was just awesome.Acting was very good. The best trilogy of all time is ""LORD OF THE RINGS"" trilogy"
"It is such a good mix between almost any kind of movie genres, the best adventure-drama-action film, mixed up with thrilling scenes, and a little bit of comedy and mystery. Such a perfect recipe for making this perfect cinematographic masterpiece. New Zealand landscapes which are part of the film made, in my opinion, the difference between this film and the other good films of our movie history. Almost all the actors are now famous because of the lord of the rings films so this says it all... At the same time, all the soundtrack is majestic and thrilling at any part during the film. Peter Jackson undoubtedly made history producing the Lord of the Rings films and especially the Return of the King, he will remain in history for ever and he will never be forgotten."
"Peter Jackson and one of the directors that I love so much and once again He has made a masterpiece film.Il Lord of the Rings and a movie Crazy I like so much for this I gave him 10 stars because for me and the best film that we SIA.Anche if this film was released so time ago I remember it as a masterpiece won 11 Oscar awards Other prizes that do not remember it was a crazy movie that I remember lifetime. One last thing the exceptional cast on all counts view, above all the actors who have been involved have been able to acting in the right way which is why this film is extraordinary, It remains today one of the best films in cinema history."
"One of the Greatest Movies of all time!!!!!!! this movie is an instant classic and amazing! I love the story and characters behind this amazing trilogy of movies! The fight scenes are very well made and the acting is flawless. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves fantasy movies that has a good plot, adventure, action, comic relief, and being able to watch it over and over again. This movie got 11 Oscars for very good reasons and it deserves every single one of them. In order to watch this movie you have to watch the first two movies of the Lord of the Rings trilogy which starts with The Fellowship of the Ring and followed by the Two Towers. The Lord of the Rings is and always will be one of my favorite stories of all time! If you have not seen The Lord of the Rings, go to a store and buy all 3 movies to watch them immediately it will be worth your money and time!"
"This has to be the best trilogy ever. Although there have been other amazing trilogies, such as The Godfather, Star Wars and the Batman films, I don't think any of them are as good as the Lord of the Rings. Its a must watch for anyone! The graphics are still very good and Peter Jackson has used a variety of film angles to really entice the audience. It most definitely deserved the many rewards it achieved.I recommend anyone who decides to watch the film, to watch it in chronological order. The first film, Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring, introduces the story, the characters, and the situation. It also provides an understanding to the what the ring does, and why its so powerful The second film, Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, allows the audience to understand the adventure while also allowing the audience to follow and root for certain characters. the introduction of new characters provides a more detailed analysis of the situation. This film summarised the story with a very interesting ending. This is a highly recommended film and I encourage everyone to watch it."
"I do not get impress so easily to Give very good rating it is not my cup of Tea, So far only 9 titles I have rated 10.This Movie Is on Top of those 9 Titles.Why ? I like a complete Package mean it should have :- Best scenic beauty, (if it is their). Character's :- Best and very clear. Animation Part is Best and clear. Best Music. Perfect amount of Humour,emotions & comedy. Powerful story. Movie runs in speedy And specially when movie runs 201 minutes in 2003 and even today is a very BIG BIG BIG Disadvantage but in this case when time End we do not know I specially wished it should have lasted a little more.Conclusion :-I Feel lucky that movie was released before my Death and I was able to Watch It."
"It was a very cool and inspiring movie, it was kind of long for my taste, maybe that's why I only gave it an 8 but I really felt close to the story from beginning to end, even though it was kind of long i still actually wanted more. I know that sounds a little contradictory but the movie just pulled me in and brought me to a place where I was actually sucked into the whole world of the lord of the rings and I felt what everyone was feeling and although it was long time seemed to move by fast and 3 hrs felt almost like 1 or 1 and a half which for my taste is kinda long or just pushing it, maybe that's why it was a little confusing for me time wise but overall I thought it was a solid movie. As far as the acting I thought it was good. No one really stood out on that front but maybe that's what they were going for so nobody really out shined another actor, it was a team effort at I admired that."
"This movie is perfect as a end of a great franchise! The plot continues perfectly and the battle scenes are better than before. I still think that The Two Towers is the best LOTR, but this one is of great quality too. All the actors really show everything they can and together with all the great visual effects, this is a movie to remember for the rest of my life. I really think everyone should have seen this movie and the other films by the end of their lives. I cannot stop saying how much I enjoyed this movie. I rate this movie 9 out of 10 because its just one of the best movies I have ever seen. Some people told me to rate it 10 out of 10, but of course, there is no perfect movie."
"I've changed my review after having watched The Hobbit all the way through on all three installments. I sat down on a Saturday afternoon and watched them together finishing later in the evening.While I still enjoy the cinematography, the makeup, FX, costumes and the acting, I enjoy the direction less. I'm less enthusiastic of the added excessive fluff to the story so they could stretch it out over the three installments to make more money.The entire Trilogy could have been edited down to (2) movies with (3) hours each. The fluff could all be thrown out and it wouldn't hurt the trilogy at all. I'd love to see some one edit the (9) hours down to (3) or (4) hours, much like The Phantom Edit did for The Phantom Menace.7/10 is my new rating for this movie and the other installments."
"This is an absolutely phenomenal movie that deserves its place on the top 250, besides that its higher than fight club, which I do not agree with, but I am not going to focus on that. It is a great end to the trilogy, and it blows the other ones away. Highly recommended, one of my favorites. however, if you do not have a high attention span, then you will need to pull through it, but I think that you will most likely find the 3 and a half hours very worth it, like I definitely did. It is a great movie that will give you a great experience, and it is an absolutely, all around, epic movie to watch when you have the time to sit down and watch it through."
"To me this is easily the worst Lord of the Rings film, primarily because it simply does not know how to end. We have a total of four false finishes before this gargantuan trilogy finally leaves us in peace. In fairness, this is the story's fault, not the film maker's. That Jackson was able to adapt these books is a stunning achievement.The practical effects are absolutely stunning, as is the cinematography. This is one of the finest looking films ever. One need only compare this to the Hobbit films, to get an impression of the amazing scale of the LOTR achievement.My main issue with Lord of the Rings is the lack of truly compelling characters. To me, Gollum is the only truly great character. Characters like Gimli and Legolas are paper thin, and everyone in between is basic. Again this isn't really the film makers fault in my opinion. For me this is the best that could possibly have been done in adapting these stories to cinema. They're the kind of stories that really are more suited to the pages of a book. Perhaps Jackson could have trimmed a little more fat than he did, and it would have made a more concise and impactful film, certainly the extended cut is vastly worse.So for me this is a fantastic spectacle, brilliantly acted by most of the cast. I feel that the story is limited, especially on screen, and that means the film is bashing it's head on a glass ceiling. Eight out of Ten."
The hobbit movies are better. But it is still all the middle earth movies are good. This movie as a great story line. It is one of the scariest movie made before 2012. It has great acting. Great special effects. Great visual effects. Great movie See it. It has a lot of action. It is long but so fast past that you will not notes. You could watch the first 2 movies first and you still wont notes the time going by. This is a great movie. One of the beast fantasy movie ever made. It is so cool. See all the middle earth movies they are awesome. Great movie great movie great movie great movie. See it see it see it see it see it see it see it. Some of scariest movie monsters are in this film.
"The trilogy of lord of the rings is a master piece,i would suggest to any one who is fan of fantasy movies to watch it and better start from the begin . This movie is a master piece it includes everything you need to see first all it gives us a installment of mystery then to keep us alive and not to get bored it puts us in a action stance,i am thrilled of this trilogy and i wanna suggest it to the ones who haven't seen yet . Although for those who will start with this movie they better start with the fist movie of lord of the rings so they can understand the movie because it has some unexplained things.That's all for me folks sorry for my grammar hope haven't you bored enough :) Keep it straight"
"First watched this movie only 3 months ago having been well acquainted with the grossly underrated Bakshi version. I simply cannot put into words the sheer awesome epic-ness of this third instalment! The Lord of the Rings film trilogy is one of the greatest achievements in filmmaking... Peter Jackson & co did an excellent job and should be immensely proud of themselves. Stunning visuals, a perfect score, great acting, memorable scenes, and more. The film does deviate from the book a bit. Why Shelob couldn't have done what she did in TTT is beyond me. It could have shortened the running time a bit. Ah yes, the running time...My one gripe is the running time & multiple endings (as others have pointed out). Its a very long movie but i enjoyed every single second of it and i think it could not have been done better. Simply epic! 10.1/10"
"I have to admit i did not see LOTR until a year ago or so but after i watched it i will never see a movie the same again. Peter Jackson,with this movie, proves himself as one of the greatest director of all times.and the result of that is that this movie is AWESOOME!All the actors and actresses did a superbly good job also making the movie what it is,OK but who i think really kills it in this movies is Andy Serkis.Andy Serkis as gollum is the best casting choice ever he did such a good job at making every scene he is in count especially the end scene, and if you've scene the movie you know what i mean.So the lord of the rings is great i think it more than deserved all the Oscar wins it got and perfectly establishes itself as one of the greatest movies of all time.I'll give it a perfect score 10 out of 10."
"i am writing this review from a country where people only watches Hollywood movies because they thought there will be action , fighting in it, they does not understand the language though but they do understand the story as movie progresses, When i watch the LOTR back in 2006 for the first time, i was one of them, watch it for fun thrill and action, i watch it again when i understand the language to some extent, i find this movies more and more interesting and i was like fall in love with this movie, i have watched it infinite number of times, and still planning to watch the extended , 3d what ever version are available now in market. This review is for the peoples who are going to watch this. I suggest them to wait till the launch of ""The Hobbit : There and Back Again"" , and then start watching The Lord Of The Ring (Trilogy)and the The Hobbit's Movies , you will love all of the six movies in a proper sequence, i even thought that movies is more powerful then off its real books. but hats off to J. R. R. Tolkien for writing such an astonishing story."
"What to say?? This trilogy sets up a totally new standard of filming and if anyone wants to compete with this piece of art surely have a big job to do. Cant tell you how much I enjoy watching these movies. Totally a new world, visually very impressive, acting at very high level to, action keeps you entertained during the whole movie and watching these three movies makes you sad because they least ""only"" 11 hours . Cant have enough of these movies. Its been 11 years since I watched for the first time and I still feel hungry for them. I think that many years will pass until someone will make a better movie than LOTR and in my opinion for 50 years this trilogy will keep very high place on IMDb list because these movies are timeless."
"It is 2014 and I still don't get tired of seeing this movie. And by this movie I'am not referring to the third part but all of them. It is a movie that has everything you'd like to be in a movie: it is the movie with more body count (836 only in this part!!), it has action, adventure and even you could see romance between some characters.It is impossible to get bored with this film, it is full of epic quotes, epic scenes and epic wars, all this complemented with a good story.All in all, this movie deserves a 10 and in my humble opinion it is the best movie you can see ever. Many years will have to pass to see a movie better than this."
"I'm so glad Peter Jackson adapted these brilliant books from JRR Tolkien... A world in which we can escape as spectator and as actor too...Thank you Mr Jackson !We can travel in Middle Earth through the beautiful work of the whole crew and those Oscars were widely deserved.The Hobbit Trilogy is different, but I trust Peter Jackson to finish it with wits and through the whole experience of those ten last years.I'm waiting to see There and Back Again though, cause the end won't be easy to adapt. Hopefully, it should blow everyone's mind !A Mellon, hobbit in modern times."
"The Lord of the Rings - The Two Towers is truly an amazing film and the middle part of the sweeping Lord of the Rings saga of films by Peter Jackson.It is obviously very highly rated and critically acclaimed but for whatever reason it is not as loved as the first and third parts of the Lord of the Rings franchise. The first part obviously sets everything up and begins the journey and part three is all about the climax and resolution with some obviously really huge stuff going on, but part two has just as much action.I'd rank them: Part 3, then Part 2, then Part 1, in order of enjoyment and how much action there was in each film.My only downside for part two is that it ends kind of abruptly in a weird place, it would have been better to have the story go a bit longer in part two instead of saving the spider etc and so much more for part three."
"This trilogy is the best movie I ever saw. It contains everything that you will see in a movie fantasy, horror, drama, action, romance, some comedy and more. The effects are great and it's based on one of the best book I ever read. Either the cast is very good chosen. Jackson made everything good. It was great as I saw it for the first time. After that I saw the movies about teen times and every time I liked it more and more. I was very happy as I heard the news that the Hobbit begun to be filmed and as I saw the first part I was very happy. Only the cast was not very good for me but in all it was good. I can't wait to see in the cinemas the second part of the Hobbit."
Wonderful movie by all standards I did not find any faults worth mentioning Cast: wonderful Output: terrific Production: Excellent Everything perfectly I loved all the actors and the roles that they Performed ----------------------------------------------- Battles: The last thing ..... frankly I did not watch the epic movie to such a degree Battles give you a real sense of performance The story in general is very beautiful and not where any faults worth mentioning The course of the story as well as a very very same story Excellent cutting scenes Excellent graphics Filming of Professional. I do not know what to say more than one piece only ... Thanks to everyone who contributed to this wonderful work
"Please note that I already wrote a review for this title but for some reason it did not make it to my review list. So here we go again.This is definitely one of the best films from the Lord of the Rings Trilogy.There are so many excellent reviews about this film that I have not much to add.Visual effects are excellent, plot is excellent, acting is excellent.There is nothing else you can do then just lay back and enjoy a masterpiece like this.My friend who does not like the films in general actually bought dvds with all three of the Lord of Rings films.So it is a must see!"
"After I finished watching the Two Towers (Which wasn't as good as the First one), My expectations were kinda low for this one. This all changed ten minutes into the movie.Firstly, The script is great! The story was awesome with only minor flaws. The acting was superb, And you really feel like your part of it. The soundtrack was awesome too. It greatly added to the whole effect and suited the movieOverall, I'd give it a 9/10. I would've given it a 10, but the ending gets a bit confusing though it was nice otherwise. This is one Trilogy you cant miss!"
"Not sure if there will be enough words to describe this epic story. The first time that i watched Lord of the Rings, was back when it was released to much fanfare. To be honest, i found my self most disappointed, primarily because i could not understand the head or tail of what was happening in the movie. I gave up on the trilogy and did not think about it until this year. With my amazon kindle, i thought of a new strategy. I read the first book and then watched the first part, and believe me, it was an out of the world experience. Then i did the same with the other 2 parts. I watched the movie only after having read the entire book, and it was absolute pleasure. The only way to do true justice to this movie trilogy is to read the books first and it totally changes the experience of watching the movie.Finally i have to say that this is one of the best movie adaptations of a book that i have ever seen. The ultimate story of courage, honor, friendship, loyalty, and hundreds of other adjectives. A must watch..."
"This movie was totally magnificent. Peter Jackson really shown 3 things, he has created a saga as good maybe even better than star wars, it has shown that it is way superior than the books, and he has shown one of the best movies of all time. This movie won everything it was nominated for (eleven) and really deserved it. This movie was the only fantasy to ever win best picture, and the third to win 11 Oscars. This movie has brilliant effects, acting, and anything else you can want from a film. The hobbits acted way better than the second one, this did have and ending, and it was the best of the saga. It is all i can say, and let me rephrase it, I am a strict critic, and this movie has shown one of the best achievements ever. It is totally over-the-top recommended."
"Now here we are with the big one. The film that is often called the best film of the decade. The gigantic mass of epic known as The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King. Everyone looks at this film as the best. In fact not only the best but the best by far is what people consider this film to be. It was nominated for 11 Oscars including best picture, and won every Oscar it was nominated for. It was a huge success, and yes this film is fantastic. It is one of the biggest adventures I have ever seen. Everything that was great in the first two are great here also. The writing, visuals, acting are all top notch stuff. So is it the best in the trilogy? Well I consider all 3 to stand together as one huge film experience. If any one of them didn't exist the others wouldn't be as good. All of them standing together give us a complete, and epic adventure.4 stars out of 4"
"LOTR 3 is one of the best movies ever made and all the Oscars it got were completely well deserved! In fact, i would add a couple. Viggo Mortensen, Ian McKellen and Bernard Hill all deserved a Best Actor nomination. And i would also mention Sean Bean who's performance of Boromir in the first part was completely underrated! It was a great performance and i can't believe he wasn't nominated! I am usually a big fan of the book's. I've noticed that some people complain about Peter Jackson completely changing the dialog and some scenes. It's true. He did do that but i think it's actually better this way. Don't get me wrong, the book's are magical. It's just that certain scenes and dialog would look and sound dull when seen on movies. Peter Jackson knew it and he had to make a certain changes. I'm glad he did! Visual's are revolutionary for the time and great for today, writing is great, directing is great, acting is great, cinematography is great, make up is great, costimography is great, fighting choreography is great,... and so on... and so on...All in all, this movie is just brilliant!!! One of the best movies ever to be made and definitely the best movie in it's genre. Deserves all the award's and all the hype it got!!! A TRUE MASTERPIECE!"
"I did not read the books before watching this, well i read The Fellowship the Ring, the first on before watching just this movie, the third. Because i loved the first two to death. And i am writing this review for all three because i see them as one big movie divided by three. But i think The Return of the King is the best one so that is why i write the review here. I think The Lord of The Rings Trilogy is the best movie/movies in history. Great acting, great environments, great characters, great story, great world, great....i could go on forever. Everything is just perfect. I could not say much more. Just watch it, all three movies, and you will be crushed by movie beauty, crushed under the feet by this undefeated masterpiece. Best movie of all time. Thank Mr. Peter Jackson and JJR Tolkien for this."
Well...Let's Just say i'm 12 years old...the first time i watched it i was 7 now i still watch it every single day. NoT many words can describe Lord of the Rings some of them maybe Mesmerising Unbeilevable...But for me it was pro bely the most Effecting movie i have ever witnessed. When i watch it i always get goosebumps...ALWAYS never once have i not been star struck by it. Now to all of you Tolkien Haters out there who call LOTR nerdy lets just say F*** YOU!!!! Now honestly i recommend these movies to pretty much everyone. Now I admit that there are too many endings(6 to be precise) but who honestly gives if you spend 5 years of your life loving this movie intensely no matter how many endings it has they will all make you cry.
"I think everything has been written that there is to write about this film. Upon seeing the film I realize and regret having being so generous in my voting history. This film trilogy stands alone with nothing to compare with. My dear reader, if you haven't seen the trilogy you surely have something to look forward to. Acting par excellence, an outstanding story etc. The trilogy appeals to grown children in all ages, but I think one should be at least 5-7 years for fully enjoy it. Having small children at home (3 and 1 year) I know that somewhere in the future I will be reliving the film with them and relive my childhood again."
"Few films can approach ""Return of the King"" in terms of scope, awe and sheer emotional storytelling. The acting by the entire crew from Viggo Mortensen to Christopher Lee to Elijah Wood is top notch. I also believe what separates ""Return of the King"" (and the trilogy in general)from all films of its type is the use of a serious (almost intense) cinematic approach to the material. Science-fiction, action and fantasy films often are almost always tongue-in-cheek because of the implausibility of the storyline. However Jackson and crew approach the material with the correct amount of humor, visual style and tone to create a unique fantasy adventure, which truly honors Tolkien's vision. Peter Jackson creates a terrific conclusion to Tolkien's novel and in the process created a trilogy by which all action and fantasy films and epics will be judged by for years to come. A 10 out of 10."
"OK Words cannot explain the sheer greatness of this movie. It is no questions asked the Best Movie Ever Made. This movie is a Masterpiece. I don't care what you think this movie made me cry several times. With Brilliant casting every Freaking emotion in this movie was so Believable that I worship it. IT...IS...Flawless. Absolutely Flawless. Brilliant battle sequences while at the same time staying so completely true to the book. I worship Peter Jackson and J.RR Tolkien. It would appeal to the most diverse audience in the world. This is the Ultimate movie. I know a person who was in this movie very personally. Literally the most thunderous movie ever. Like I said earlier words cannot explain the sheer greatness of this movie. More than a movie but a brilliant, Flawless Work of art...a FREAKIN"" WORK OF ART."
"This movie is one of the most beautiful movies yet!! Peter Jackson knows how to draw the audience in and knows how to tug at their heart-strings. Sean Astin was BRILLIANT in these 3 LOTR movies. Love him. Elijah Wood was also excellent... even if he had no dialogue and he had to act with just his eyes... that would be good enough for me. For everyone out there who has not yet seen this movie... I'd highly suggest you have a box of tissues on hand. =) The entire cast was incredible. I think all of them deserved an award for their acting. Can't forget about Cate Blanchett... she was fantastic. One of Australia's best actresses... alongside Nikki Kidman, Naomi Watts, Judy Davis, Rachel Griffiths and Toni Collette."
"Before I begin my comment on the Greatest Movie Of All Time, I would like to express my strong belief that anyone who gave this movie anything below a 7 should be sent to prison for crimes against humanity. Furthermore, anyone who is still confused should e-mail me and I will gladly educate you (or you should watch the first two movies first, moron).As if the books weren't good enough, Peter Jackson brings Tolkien's masterpiece to the silver screen. The story is masterfully told and every single character was cast perfectly. Though Jackson does not follow the books exactly, I believe that J.R.R. would be proud. John Rhys-Davies and Andy Serkis provide just enough comic relief to keep the movie from becoming too serious, and the acting is amazing. And don't get me started on the fight scenes. The greatest movie-making technology ever created combined with Jackson's expertise and Tolkien's genius make for a thrilling adventure. 10 out of 10."
"I has been a several years now since visual effects impressed the audience into marking a movie great. Since the computer generated effects for Jurassic Park in 1994, gradually it has become a standard for all movies.Even comedies now are expected to use respectable visual effects. Of course, now we are used to computer animations. The first Matrix had us drooling on the new 360 degrees visual effect. Now I don't think anyone is impressed by it.I think this is good. Because sometime after the start of this new millennium, big movie studio executives still think special effects will push a movie to the top in the box office. Not anymore. The Lord of the Rings is faithfully based on a master piece of literature. Tolkien dedicated a lifetime in creating this book. It would be great for a writer to continue on his work. To add-on the ages to after the Lord of the Rings.In conclusion, Definitely we have to expect great stories backed by great special effects, not the other way around."
"As the series has caught on to a new franchise, attracting younger viewers and tugging a whole new look to the style of Tolkien's world, attention to detail becomes flawed and relentless in trying to sound clever in some of the lines; and characters begin to make conversations that are unnecessary that you've all heard before. Such as: ""Middle Earth will fall to the hand of SAURON."" being quoted by nearly ten people in the series.It possesses inner qualities in it's self that are more miscellaneous rather than real movie quality. It's clichéd, it's corny and repetitive, but that's what makes it brilliant. The fact that everything is coming to an end in a great adventure to end all adventures is the main interior of this epic series climax that we see before us conquers all of your reason to criticise and leaves you on the edge of your seat...that is, after two hours and forty-five minutes...The rest of the film is absolutely abysmal, and there is no point in the last three scenes except for filler material. If those last scenes were the overall quality of the film, this would be 4/10. Because it is a pure waste of time to look at the last twenty minutes.Another huge flaw, is that all the bits you actually didn't want to miss that were from the book are missed and some of the things you desperately wanted to observe are on sale for £10-20. They are all put on as extras on DVD video.I give this a strong 8, for reasons I said earlier. No doubt the worst film in the series, but you could still watch this over and over again and never get bored...I hope the new Peter Jackson movie bodes well, as he puts King Kong at the centre of his new phenomenon, because he's been a brilliant director for the LOTR series."
"as blockbusters go, this was above average, but as a Tolkien loving boy, my hopes were slightly dashed by the exclusion of amazing scenes and beautiful duologue which is specific to the book. all in all my least favorite of the three films, and ironically rated the highest. peter jackson is not what i would consider aptly picked to direct these movies. there are many awkward and quick camera changes and some bad green screen work in all three movies, a signature, in my mind of a less mature director. I'm sure people would like to point out all of the other films he has directed but few of them have been in the vein and trend of sweeping fantasy epics. viggo mortensen plays an amazing lead man with support from Rhys Davies. theodons character is also brought to life vividly from the pages of the book. and there is some marvelous cinematography in many scenes. another minor grievance i have with the movies follows the tarrantino philosophy: why add back scenes left on the cutting room floor? you should have made the movie you wanted to the first time around. i am particularly harsh of movies, so to receive a seven is a blessing this is a positive review, so please, no angry emails. i enjoyed this movie nearly more than any other which came out in its year."
"This movie is simply one of the best. Winner of 11 Academy Awards and well deserving. This epic conclusion to the story should just make everyone happy that Peter Jackson and Company even decided to make this trilogy.Story: 10 Graphics: 10 Action: 10 Acting: 10The only thing about this movie is that the ending is too drawn out. When you think the movies over there's still about a half hour left. But that doesn't really contribute to you not liking the movie. The ending, though it is drawn out, is happy. After three movies you are glad to see that everything turns out for the better in Middle Earth. An amazing display of film making.Amazing, 10/10"
"This is the best movie ever made, it is a masterpiece. I wish i could thank Peter Jackson to just tell him how much of a masterpiece this movie is. It is the movie that inspired me to make movies and it is my favorite movie. Unless you don't understand the story you will like it. The whole trilogy is worth watching, but this one is the best, even though it is really hard to decide. Peter Jackson is the best director I've ever seen and this looks like this is going to be the best movie for a long time. I don't know how you can not like lord of the rings but I'm guessing it is cause people don't understand the story and get bored of it because its too long, but trust me, stop reading this and buy the whole trilogy and then buy the whole trilogy's extended edition."
"I have bought every other Special Gift edition of the Extended version so far. And each one seems to be a much better movie. Much more well rounded off. I just have some questions about the most reesnt edition. DOES IT HAVE THE SQOUERING OF THE SHIRE?!?!?!??!?! lol I KNOW I KNOW.. i cant spell but, I was SOOOo disappointed when the first edition did not include it!!!!!!!!! And when i realized that the extended edition was coming, I have been crossing my fingers ever since I watched this movie. please tell me! lol And what other new scenes were included? does it have """"""SHARKY""""""""The world is quiet here"""
"I love this movie, with it's scenery, music and story. I haven't read any of the books in the trilogy, but I love the movies, all of the them. It's a movie that I think is going to be a classic trilogy. It makes me feel warm when I've seen it. The only bad thing about it for me is that it's to short. When you see this movie, you forget everything but this story. One of the many things I love about this movie is that it isn't so many things that they made digitally. I love the characters in the movie, the elves, the dwarfs, the men and the hobbits. I also like the orcs, the uruk-hais and the ringwraiths. But it's hard to really explain why it's such a great movie, you have to see it to understand it's greatness."
"The movie is better than a kick to the face, but it is too long - I couldn't wait to get out of the theater. I read the book(s) and felt the same way about them - TOO LONG! In fact Tolkien said he wanted, ""to try his hand at a really long story that would hold the attention of readers, amuse them, delight them, and at times maybe excite them or deeply move them."" Well he got the really long part of it down and so did Peter Jackson. I didn't rate this film lower because it is a good film, and it did manage to bring to my attention some parts of the story that I had forgotten. Of course the film (and the whole trilogy for that matter) left out a whole lot of stuff that I do remember (and that I liked) - but I can't complain too much - if they had put those parts in the movie I might still be in the theater watching it! 7/10"
"There are three (OK maybe more?) groups of people where these films are dealing with: 1. LOTR fanatics 2. LOTR fans 3. LOTR Couldnt care less....show me the movieI am in group 2, have read the book about 8 times, but do not remember every name in it or every scene from the book. In my (humble) opinion you are never going to please all of the people all of the time, but this trilogy comes pretty damn close. the first apparent thing is it is made/directed with an great love/appreciation of the novel. To appeal to group 1 you would have to make 10 films each 4 hours long, to appeal to group 3 you would need to condense the three films into two 90 minute slice and dice movies, i really do believe these could not be better done, i could have a few needless niggles, but why bother when the overall effect is so stunning. the only sour taste left in ones mouth is what a charade, fix and outright disgrace the awards ceremonies are, as when the Two Towers 'towered' above any film that year it failed, and when it did win all before it, there was some VERY good competition, which was made to appear weak.....c'est la vie"
"I voted a grade 10 for LotR because I personally consider it as the greatest book ever and the most magnificent movie of all time!Hail to Tolkien and to Peter Jackson ,Gods in literature and film making!Hail ,also to the wonderful cast which made the story even greater(if that's possible)!And of course we must not forget the crew,which went far beyond the expectations to make Tolkien's book come to live!Bless you all!These 3 years watching the trilogy were the most magical time of my life!Thank you so much for being a part of our lives,we, your fans, will never forget you!!! ~Miss Baggins~"
"Simply one of the best films ever made. Acting, storyline, pace, drama, costume, effects, all set new standards by which future films will be judged. As close to perfect as possible given the current technology and science of film making."
"So the final book is completed in this excellent film trilogy.  It is as great as the first two.  It lacks the magic of new introductions to characters or places in the magical world of Middle Earth, but the time is spent instead on polishing the film to perfection.  In this last story, our characters meet their hardest tests and this calls for some very demanding performances which we get from everyone.And there are some absolutely fantastic scenes.  The battle scenes are very exciting and absorbing with very little gee-whiz effects.  Everything is well motivated.Will there be ""The Hobbit""?  Let's hope so."
"Like the two movies before this one I immersed myself in the story.  I am one of those who do not care that the film does not exactly matches the book.  This film, like the book, creates a magic of it's own and I laughed and cried with it. But, here drops the other boot, that ghastly scene at the end of the movie where the Hobbits endlessly hug and stare each other in the eyes... It created the same feeling of nausea that I experience when when, accidentally, watching a piece of a soap on T.V. As we say in Holland, ""it made my toes curl"". Therefore and therefore alone I rated this a 9 not a 10 like the previous 2 movies."
"Cliches, cliches, cliches and more cliches.  Melodramatic, sappy, hokey, childish... I felt like I was watching Harry Potter all over again. But at least HP was TARGETED at 10 year olds.  This movie was supposed to be an epic;  a finale. Hardly. There was nothing different between this film and either I or II, save for the fact that they finally let Frodo put the biscuit in the basket, uh, I mean the ring into the fire. Nearly 11 hours of the same build-up, movie after movie. The battle scenes were, of course, incredible but c'mon, computer-enhanced imagery and trickery has become redundant.  There is no suspense, no fright, when you know the outcome. Maybe the D&D geeks amongst us get off on this computer fantasia bull but I don't.  Really now, was there any great difference between LOTR II and III when it came to the battles, save for the bad guys were now on elephants instead of ugly, giants Orgs?  Nobody can argue that Tolkien's story is incredible - you could strip all 3 of these films of all the special effects (overkill) and the story would still be fantastic - but when you keep laying on all the pre-battle buildups and then drone on about the unconquerable power of the ring, well, after a while, I just wanna' hit the pause button so I can see what else is on."
"I liked this movie alot, It had great battle scenes that made sitting through the whole movie bearable.  It was a story that could have easily been told in half the time but they HAD to make it 3 hours long, so there are alot of drawn out scenes tht start to wear on you towards the end."
"I have seen all three LOTR movies now, and in my opinion, 'Return of the King' is my favorite movie of the three in the trilogy.  I agree with Peter Jackson when he said this movie was the more 'emotional' of the three.  All the actors put their hearts into this movie, and it shows clear as crystal."
"If you go past the inaccuracies of the book-to-film transition, RotK was one of, if not the best films I've ever seen, and that's without the incredibly hot Viggo and Karl.  So if you haven't seen it, go see it, or you'll miss out on one of the best films ever."
"I may be biased because I am a huge Lord of the Rings fan, but I just loved ""The Return of the King."" My favorite is still, of course, ""The Fellowship of the Ring,"" but Peter Jackson was certainly able to tie the movies together well with the third and last part of the ""Lord of The Rings."" Of course, this movie will be part of my purchased collection."
"The story wasn't finished as it should, but I'm expecting much from the ""extended"" edition.Beautiful pictures, and the story is hardly altered. A bit much CGI at some points but there's so much eyecandy that doesn't bother me.I think it will rise to the top of the TOP 250, and will be known as the best movie of all times..."
I went to the cinema last night...and WOW!I've got to read the books again some day (third time). Can't wait for the directors cut version :-)If you haven't seen it yet...then WHAT ARE YOU DOING???
"I thought that this was by far the best movie that i have ever seen in my life. it was soo good. everything just made it sooo good. the acting, the cinematography, music, costumes, screenplay, direction, sets, everything was just beyond marvelous. i think that it is a great movie and if u haven't seen it yet then u are missing out on something sooo greeat. so go see if u haven't i think that though it cuts out many things from the books it is still sooooo great. i loved it."
"Yes this movie could have been better, the begining 20 minutes or so are a little dissappointing, cinematically.  But the rest of the film is so phenomenal and so captures the drama of Tolkien's nearly perfect story that you completely forget that there was ever anything less than spectacular about any of these films.  Flat out, PJ gets it done in the end, and only utter perfection could have been better. A+By the way. If you haven't... READ THE BOOKS! They are even better, once you get to the forming of the fellowship, you won't be able to put any of them down."
"This was probably one of the greatest movies ever. The only downside was that they cut out too much of the movie, you could tell at times. Although what that tells me is that the extended version of this movie will be incredible. Once I see the extended edition, I will be convinced that this WAS the best movie of all time. This was the epic connclusion to this amazing tale."
"I saw this movie yesterday evening and it has been in my mind ever since. It's the best of all three of them and I was a bit sad when it was over. No more waiting around for another Lotr movie. It's the end.
For all of you fans that haven't seen it yet:Go and be amazedmy rate: 10"
"Although I read the books many years ago, I have always had a fondness for the third book: Return of the King.Peter Jackson's treatment of the trilogy and the end story especially is something for future history.  It is an extremely sensitive and insightful translation of the story from book to silver screen.  I enjoyed every moment of it.The ending is a golden moment and the care and sweetness of the film ending does the book justice.This is film history.Congradulations Peter Jackson."
"Despite the major disappearances in that script compared to the subtleties of the books that any fan will regret, this is still a great last chapter.Many trilogies never lived up to the first chapter that enticed crowds so much, the Matrix being the worst recent example!Here, all that really matters is present but I wish to raise one point: the real philosophy behind Tolkien's book gets twisted by the absence of Tom Bombadil and the scourging of the Shire. The power corrupts all and those two examples were fundamental, yet missing in Jackson's script.Tolkien's love for Nature and hate of rampant industrialisation was really one of the final notes of the book. It's missing here but it's still a great film.9/10"
The opening with Gollum's history was not necessary. We got this explained well enough in the first movie. If they had wanted it better it should have been placed in the first movie anyway.Missing out saruman. He should have been in the beginning and the end of the 3rd movie.Besides that it was a perfect movie. Thanks guys.
"In my opinion, The Return of the King is the best film in the trilogy. There where more excitement, more drama, more battles. The final battle will be remembered the most. Ghosts, pirates, BIG creatures and thousands of men and orcs fighting for Minas Tirith and Gondor."
"Yes and let me explain why we are furious, precious. Thieves! Thieves! They have stolen it from us! Peter Jackson and his crew stole our enjoyment! That fat Hobbit! How could we enjoy anymore of a movie besides The Return of the King, my precious?The Return of the King is really awesome. It is even better than the precious, yes..yes.. better than the precious. We wants it! The story, the acting, the special effects, the cinematography.....They match perfectly to each other, precious. It is an excellent end of the trilogy. The Return of the King is so fantastic that we could not enjoy anymore of another movie. That is why we are furious, precious!If this movie does not get more Academy Awards than Ben Hur or Titanic than it is a shame to the world of cinema, my dear.10/10"
"Great animation, great acting, great special effects, great, great, great everything. I can not say enough about this movie. It has everything that you can imagine. I am not going to give away any part of the movie to you. If you have not seen it, you need to. I think you probably have anyway (1st week in box office, over $125,000,000), enough said about that. If you do not give this movie a 10, then your either jealous because you didn't get a part in the movie or you are a relative or spouse of someone that got turned down in the movie. Expect this movie to get lots of awards, just remember that this is the highest gross-money making movie of all time, so far.In one part of the movie, I yelled out ""Surprise mother #&$*!("". I did not get kicked out of the movie Theatre, only because everyone else was thinking that too. I was 'getting into the movie', if you know what I mean. When I like a movie, I do not get up and use the restroom, I can hold it and that was a long movie."
now this was the best movie of the year! it is absolutely amazing! the wars were directed so well that I enjoyed it so much but it was a little bit boring in the end but all of it was absolutely stunning! it must be the best film throuout the history! and this is so much better than The Godfather.. The Godfather is so rubbish compared to ROTK
"A perfect end to a perfect trilogy. Peter Jackson did the book every bit of justice, even when charged with the task of keeping the movie under 3.5hrs :) After seeing the Fellowship 3 years ago, I dove into the origional books, and wasn't even concerned with the missing scenes from the movie(s). What was shown fit in with the other two movies to a tee.I'm glad I'm not in the ""star wars"" generation. 'cause LoTR pwns luke skywalker and his freaky father."
I LOVED THIS MOVIE! I don't really care what they didn't put in its not perfect but its close! The acting was great the visual effects were amazing. I think that peter deserves an Oscar for this and the film should win as well. This could not have ended any other way. Superb.
"sadly this is the final chapterthanks mr. Jackson, you did a great jobsaw the three films one after the other and time flew by, 9hours gone in one glorious moment"
"A story where the most important subjects of the humanity are present.  A story full of mythology, mysticism, sacrifice, the strength of destiny, friendship, goodness and evil. One of the most ambitious projects of the movie history. A saga whose destination is to pass the test of the time. Like often occur with the greatest landmarks in the history or arts."
"It is a very exciting movie with tons of action.  This movie was definitely made for the big wide screen.  It has lots of computer generated things in it, but they blend in very smoothly, and don't totally overpower the movie. For sure the best of the trilogy."
"If this doesn't recieve an Oscar, Nothing should. PERIOD....I loved every moment of it and would have sat still for the Parts they failed to include. These must have been left out because the theater owners think they need to run as many showings in a night as possible.They already ""way"" overcharge us for every little thing we buy. I would go to see this if the price was doubled... BUT please, go see it.  And PLEASE... READ the Book..."
This movie IS SPECTACULAR !!! i LOVED it !!!  Lots of action and suspense and it was sad and funny also .. it surely deserves many Academy Awards !! and i hope that Peter Jackson is duly rewarded for excellent work as well as the other actors and everyone else involved in the production of this Masterpiece !!! i HIGHLY recommend this picture for one and all !!   if i could give it a higher rating i would !!!!
"Grand, sweeping, and at times monumental. But nevertheless captures your emotions for the characters in the nostalgic manner, of Tolkien's writing, that makes it-lump-in-your-throat-difficult to say good-bye to these beloved characters. Yes I will treasure this movie and its predecessors till the end of my days."
"No film can be perfect for everyone, but this comes close! Peter Jackson found a way to convert a complex and layered story into a movie masterpiece. It could have been done a thousand different ways and still not everyone would be satisfied. This was the best shot and will be hard pressed to be surpassed. Chronicles of Narnia, Star Wars Episode III, the next Harry Potter movie have a new bar."
"This is the best movie I've ever seen in my whole entire life. This is the best movie of the whole trilogy. I loved it. The movie is simply wonderful and breathtaking. I love the scenary, special effects, strong acting and plot. I loved the battle scenes, those were awesome! I can't wait for the extended edition dvd. This movie just rocks. You've got to see it at a theatre NOW! You won't regret it. Don't miss this fine piece of cinema!"
"Just a visionary as Peter Jackson is, could have the chance to bring us an spectacular Masterpiece as The Return of The King, the unbelievable final chapter of the Lord of The Rings saga. It is the perfect example to describe how the talent of a few human beings is used to make this kind of gift.Thanks JRR Tolkien !! Thanks Peter Jackson, & all the crew !!Alvaro Morales, Valencia Venezuela"
"What an extraordinary accomplishment Peter Jackson and team have created. As promised, the best of the three films.  Splendid acting from Sean Astin, Viggo Mortensen, Ian McKellen.  Astounding effects that were completely in character. Remarkable story construction from the writers and Director Peter Jackson. We laughed, we cried, we cringed, we held our breathes, we cried again.  Seldom has a film grabbed my emotions so tightly.  I think a new Oscar category is needed.  Best Picture just isn't adequate to describe this climax of an epic trilogy."
"I admit I have an irrational fondness for these films, loving them more each time I see them. I know others here have said this, but if you've only seen ROTK once, go again. There's too much to absorb on first viewing. I've seen it several times, each time in a large, filled or nearly filled theatre, and I think it speaks to the power of the filmmaking and the story that I marvel each time at how little squirming, shuffling, and sighing there is for such a long movie. Granted, there are people who hate the ending(s), but again, on second viewing, it feels right and deserved. I'm sad only that there won't be another one to look forward to next December."
"This is movie making at its superlative best .... imaginative, innovative, sensitive and visually superb.  Tolkien said that LOTR was not based on anything, and was not allegorical.  That may be true but you can't help but think that his time in the trenches in WW1 had an enormous impact on him which he exorcised in the writing of the LOTR trilogy. 
The brutality of hand to hand combat, the desecration of the land and the power of an evil mastermind ultimately leading to death on a scale never seen before.  I doubt that anyone could have made a better movie version of the trilogy than Peter Jackson.  What can we look forward to next from this creative genius?"
"What? I would have given a 12 on this movie... It simply is awesome. When you think that most movies adapted from a book leave some after-taste, like something is missing. With Return of the King, there is no such bad feelings about it. Far from that. It simply is the best movie I've seen with lots of emotions and larger than life scenes that leave you breathless.12 thumbs up!"
"This movie is visually the best of the trilogy. The oliphaunts were even more well done than I could imagine, and the other ""new"" characters were all exactly as I remember them from the books. Jackson also does a good job wrapping up all loose ends, although the very end did not seem to come when I thought it should. But, I must say, I was impressed with the deepness of the story as told by J.R.R. Tolkien through the eyes, cameras, and CGI of Peter Jackson and company."
"First of all, let me say I have never read the books. (That is my next step) I can't say enough about ROTK.  This movie will, without a doubt, go down as one of the greatest movies of all time, I certainly am not aware of any sequel that parallels this movie in any way.  The acting was superb, the story was obviously amazing.  Sean Astin as Sam should win an oscar for his picture.  Dare I say best picure as well?  And finally the ending was just perfect.  As I was watching the last 20 minutes, I just nodded my head gently up and down, and thought ""Yeah, this is the way this movie needs to end, this is perfect""  For all those who have not seen the movie, you are in for such a special treat!"
"As i watched the battle before the black gate a single tear streamed down my face exactly like wormtounges before the army of saruman.  The true beauty of this movie trilogy shall never be forgotten in my time, they are truly the greatest set of movies ever created, to go along with the books similar reputation."
"Indeed, a more appropriate name would have been ""Lord of the Trash"". I have not seen anything sicker, perverse or violent than this one especially considering the Oscars it won. It says a lot about the culture and times we live in.No doubt, a lot of money has been spent and a lot of effort has gone in. But what is the final result ? Violence, blood and gore..... What is the purpose I wonder ? Has human culture stooped so low that we need such forms of entertainment ?Its time Lord of the Rings is confined to the dustbins of history! Awful, filthy and violent piece of crap.Here goes the story. Apparently somebody has forged a bunch of rings and given some to different groups of beings on a fantasy place called Middle Earth. One of these rings is more powerful than the others. So there is this big bad guy who wants it to dominate the others. So the good guys decide that it is better to destroy the ring than let it fall in the hands of the evil guy. The rest of this garbage is full of magic and sorcery. Things do not make sense at all ! Any idiot can write a stupid story like this...."
"Yeah I know that a lot of people like or love the whole trilogy, but I think this trilogy and the ""Hobbit"" trilogy are overrated. OK the films aren't bad, but it are simply fantasy films and eleven Ocsars are absolutely to many for this movie. A few of them have the film well earned, but not exact eleven like Ben Hur or Titanic. Maybe is my awful view about the film only, because I like fantasy films not really, but looking this movie was hard for me and than the horrible information that this movie WIN ELEVEN Oscars, give me the final think that this movie simply OVERRATED is. Even if the film is not really terrible, only overrated."
"Lord of the Rings is an overlong piece of crap from one of the biggest hacks in Hollywood. Peter Jackson used to make low-budget horror films that were amazing. Now he makes big Hollywood movies with big Hollywood stars. His aim now isn't to make good movies. His aim is now to make as much money as he can. Why can't Hollywood start making films that are actually good instead of films that they make to reel in cash? Who needs so much money? Why does Peter Jackson need more money??? Seriously, Peter Jackson needs to stop making movies. He ruined King Kong recently, and he made three films that are ENTIRELY TOO LONG based on a crappy OVERLONG series. Get this film off the top 250 of all time. IT SUCKS."
"This movie is a pain.Simply horrible, boring, too long, bad acting, bad writing.Pratically i don' t save nothing of this pile of garbage.The fake-looking special effects are some of the worst i have ever seen.The sad thing is that this overrated turkey won so many Oscar:quite a testament of the low level of the academy awards.Terrible.The editing is a complete mess, the only saving grace are the wonderful New Zealnd landscapes.How many ending it had? 10, 20, come on, it's simply laughable.In conclusion, a very bad and overrated movie.Another thing:this movie is number 3 of all the time? IMDb webmaster, it's time to change the IMDb vote modalities."
"Yeah great looking, but really boring, boring and boring movie. Giving such a great ratings for this ""masterpiece"" is eating the top movie list, since this really isn't great movie, just nice arts, etc. But NOTHING more. The first two were even better than this one. This is all just about how great effects they can make for movie. But well maybe people like this kind of movies nowadays, I want MORE IN movies, not just good looking movies, but good MOVIES. Have to say I'm generally disappointed movies nowadays, most of movies are just about how they look, not about writing, characters, etc. Good that some does like this movie, but I really don't. Last 30-40minutes I were just eating popcorn and thinking about my next days program. 4/10"
I feel like I'm on another planet when I hear people talk about this movie. It is probably the worst movie that I have ever seen. Its only rivals are the two previous LOR movies. Was there some weird subliminal suggestion that I'm immune to? Were they serving some drugged cool-aid that I missed?
"Stupid movie, already slightly better than the first 2 installations.  At least we did not sleep for more than an hour during the show and caught the ending.What's the fuss about these movies?  Spectacular views?  Well, why not take a tour in Australia and experience the views first hand?"
"This movie blurs into the first two. There is nothing unique about it. The ugly fantasy creatures and the crescendo of  fighting battles are boring beyondbelief. Orlando Bloom, as the cool elf guy, is the highlight of this otherwise monotonous three hour fiasco. I can't believe this horrendously disgusting film would receive academy awards. I am so glad this trilogy is over with. Please let there be no more!"
Peter Jackson managed to make an outstanding film version of the favorite book of millions of people all over the world and justified their hopes. He is worthy of respect. It's great film! Go to the cinema immediately!
"Follow in ""The Lord of the Rings"" creator's (J.R.R. Tolkien's) footsteps. Project a malevolent universe. Invent a world and animate it with creatures in conflict. Make the conflict a battle between good and evil, but don't identify clearly the moral value or purpose of either side. In fact, remove morality's essence altogether by eliminating the power of choice for your characters. Emphasize the corruptibility of men. Glamorize the supernatural. Dwell interminably on the preparations for and the wreaking of violence and destruction, on the fragility of hope and happiness. Name the scene of action: Middle-earth. Sound like an environment you'd care to envision? Would you ""live"" there? If so, fate alone will decide its survival and your own. You can visit this predetermined ""paradise"" by watching/enduring/suffering Peter Jackson's elaborately filmed adaptation of Tolkien's epic trilogy, which concludes with ""The Return of the King."" I hold it is true that what is not worth contemplating in life is not worth contemplating in art. For its dismaying lack of meaningful moral definition, its pervasive pictorial ugliness, the quantity of its scenes of mind-numbing graphic violence, and its minimizing of the value of happiness, ""The Lord of the Rings"" films--including this one--ought to be shunned and damned."
"Perhaps I can't lay all the blame on Peter Jackson. The story was dumb to begin with. For those that don't know, the idea of the ring originates from Plato's ""The Republic"", The Ring of Gyges. Basically this ring gives Gyges the power of invisibility, which he exploits to take over some kingdom and yada yada. Not a very interesting story on its own, but good within the context of ""The Republic."" Glaucon and Plato were arguing over the tendency of man to do good over evil and vice versa. LOTR does not intertwine philosophical explorations with a clever plot. Instead it merely takes this stupid ring story out of its origin and assumes that is insightful. Blah.This is why I rarely akin to fantasy. Its authors are prone to employing cheap fiction. Thanks for making America even dumber Peter Jackson. Never make another movie, please."
"I know all the fans of the books loved the LOTR movies, but I never could stomach the books, never got more than 125 pages into the first one, even though I tired a dozen times. The books were tremendously dull, and uninspired. the movies were very true to this vision. Think about it for a few minutes, what exactly happened over the course of about 10 hours of film ? A few creatures went for a walk with some computer animated ""battles"" along the way. Big whoop. Dull, bored me to sleep. If I could write ten lines about how dull this movie series was, I might inspire you readers to the same amount of dis-interest that these movies make arise in me. I was enthralled by a lot of the scenery shots, but the dull color palette used in most of the scenes was just as unappealing as the dull plot. I'm not going to bother comparing this to another series of movies, because I can't think of another instance of such patently dull movies being so universally heralded. I wish some really good books would be afforded the lavish treatment these dry tomes got."
"So many high expectations which are all brought plummeting downward in the final episode of the saga. First of all, Orlando Bloom is gay. He is one of the most pathetic actors I have ever watched. Secondly, this movie is incredibly long and drawn out, with nothing any more interesting then what is in THE TWO TOWERS. Finally, it is very disappointing watching the poor acting coming from ELIJAH WOOD and SEAN ASTIN. They have done better in movie such as NORTH and ENCINO MAN. Fortunately, for the avid moviegoers, there are some quality fantasy/Scifi movies that you can go see. Such as MANOS: HANDS OF FATE and MORTAL KOMBAT: ANNIHALATION. The only good thing about this movie is...wait, there are no good parts about this movie. Take this review serious because I am serious. If you want to call me and talk to me about it, call 1-805-423-6182. Ask for Chris or Alex."
"I really enjoyed this movie -- well about 45 minutes of it.Unless you are a die-hard fanatic for the LOTR books (and maybe even then) you'll want to watch this with one finger on the fast forward button.Some scenes were excellent, but not enough when diluted by so much ""filler."" The special effects may have been masterful, but they didn't make it a great movie.  The movie simply takes itself far too seriously; how else could the director possibly justify being almost 3.5 hours long!?!Similarly to voters here -- this is rated as #3 in the top 250 of all time. That is *SO ASTOUNDINGLY OVERRATED* that I cannot understand it (this with 65,000+ votes).  It probably belongs in the top 1000, perhaps about #800. [How has the studio managed to create 45k+ IMDB accounts to skew the voting?]The basic flaw of the entire trilogy is that it's based on a long-winded, violently racists set of books.   Starting from that, you end up with.... well, you know.Truthfully, this is a 7/10 -- but it could have been a 7.5 if they'd actually done some editing down to ~1.5 hours."
Waste of my time and money (and the studio's).  Multiple endings were irritating.  Battle scenes gave me motion sickness.  Women's roles were disgraceful.  No plot.  Overdone computer graphics.  Popcorn and coke were good.
3hours and 15minutes long - ouchI have never seen an ending that took 45minutes.  We were so grateful that it was over.Plot stretched too thin.If the movie was 2hours long - it would have been great.
"Well, as all of the Tolkien's books are nothing more than some dumb fairy-tales , any movie based on  Tolkien's book is gonna...(well Jay and Silent Bob fans, you know the quote).I don't like, but I tolerate fanatsy in gerenal, but this is by far! Anyone who likes sitting and watching orcs and goblins speaking single-minded lines about some trashcan-worth ring for 2 hours are welcome. Any sane person KEEP OUT! 0/10"
"first of all a great thanks Peter Jackson to make people to re-live Tolkien's EPIC-Lord of the Rings trilogy. All the 3 three movies comes with a great cinematic experience, an experience that rule the hearts of millions forever, an experience that take you back to the middle earth. The direction of the the movie is perfect and the acting is treat to watch specially Sean Astin(sam) and Viggo Mortensen(aragon). All technical aspects of the movie are good. The war scenes are so perfectly created that people will love to watch. Although the movie is not as good as book but it is the best that can be created out of book and also you can't expect everything in 200 mins movie."
"This movie is one of the best movies I've ever watched. Since I watched it for the first time, I keep watching it again and again every three months or so. The director has made a great job although at the year 2000-2003 there was much less equipment and gear to use to film. The film is very smart,and thrilling! When I keep on re-watching it, I always have the same enthusiasm and the thrilling feeling despite that I know what's gonna happen. I like it how they use some technical stuff that made the experience of the movie much more better, without us noticing. The story is very interesting and it reflects what really happens deep within every person when s/he is submitted to such power; one can only use power for the good or the bad, and must know how to really not harm all the people around him while using it. It's not a simple thing to do."
"If there were three words to describe this they would be: Epic, ,Inspiring and Original The lore behind the books is amazing and to see it go on the big screen is a wonder to behold. The movie was captivating and every moment was one to cherish. This movie used music that fit in with the theme and helped create a whole new genre of fantasy, not only in movies but also with video games. The acting was excellent in my opinion as the characters were lifelike and vibrant. This movie is a must see movie and an amazing finale of the Lord of the Rings Trilogy that started with the Fellowship of the Ring and the Two Towers in an almighty battle to end it.Very well done Peter Jackson"

"The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit films are, quite frankly, the greatest films of all-time. Nothing has surpassed them, and I do not suspect anything soon will. The world it is set in is so rich, so unique, and so beautiful that you will often find yourself marveling at the sheer wonder of it all. The set and the locations are incredible, and absolutely gorgeous. The characters and writing are superb, and they are translated to screen wonderfully. They are all exactly how I imagined them while reading the books. The special effects are the best I have ever seen. The action scenes are amazing, but the films does incredible even when it is just people talking. Overall, they are the greatest films I have ever seen, and anyone who has yet to watch them needs to do so immediately."
"This story (all three films) is truly art on film! I was blown away by this film and still am today as I watch it over and over again. Peter Jackson's talent is beyond belief. This film draws you in like nothing I have ever experienced before or since. The fact that the actors were not nominated for Oscars is appalling! If Elijah Wood is not Oscar worthy they need to quit giving the damn things out! For the people that don't ""get"" the Lord of the Rings and why it's so great, this thing is NOT complicated it's a story of human emotion and the struggle between good and evil so I don't understand why that is so confusing...maybe some are just to shallow to understand those things. My 9 year old nephew gets it so trust me it's not complicated. Lord of the Rings is just simply a great work of art and if you haven't seen it you are missing out on the greatest film ever made, there is nothing else to compare, not even close"
"when I first seen this movie I was surprised... I never thought that there is a movie that good... I never knew what great acting-direction- means till I saw this movie no matter what I say I cannot tell you how great this movie is... these day there is not a lot of movies that would take you to an unforgettable journey a journey that would last in your mind 4 ever... I have seen this movie more than 300 hundred times each time i see it it gets better and bettersimply..this is the best movie ever made...this,is.a.must.see.movie"
"Superb finale to the greatest trilogy in cinematic history. Even with multiple story lines and a broad cast, it never loses its focus or its flow - something that plagued the second film every so often. Superb performances all-around, with Astin, McKellen, and Bernard Hill standing out. The action scenes are outstanding and the effects, of course, are top-notch. So many memorable images from the film. And, despite the hype, there aren't that many false endings and the film ends appropriately. However, this is the only film of the trilogy that is not improved by the extended edition. It makes it far too long and adds too many scenes (Houses of the Healing, a lot of the Army of the Dead stuff) that Jackson obviously didn't want to include and thus shortchanged them. The Army of the Dead stuff, in particular, removes much of the suspense that the theatrical cut had. The Mouth of Sauron and added Witch King stuff are welcome, though."
"First of all, did anyone notice that there was a reference to Star Wars: Return of the Jedi in this movie? Eowyn: No, I'm going to save you. Theoden: You already did. In Star Wars: Return of the Jedi, there was a scene with dialogue very similar to that. Luke Skywalker: No, I have to save you. Anakin Skywalker\Darth Vader: You already have.Second, I have an alternate scene for when Frodo, Sam, and Gollum are in the cave and Gollum is trying to get the ring:Frodo holds the ring above the lava. Frodo Baggins: You want this? Gollum growls. Frodo Baggins: Come get it then! Drops the ring. Gollum: NO! NO! MY PRECIOUS! Jumps in after the ring."
"I have a really huge problem with picking favorites, but this movie would have to be one of them. Flawless conclusion to the trilogy. Nothing is wrong with this movie.the acting, the dialog, the plot, the narrative, the cinematography, the costumes, the visual effects, the sound effects.My favorite thing about these movies is that they are science fiction, but nothing about them is difficult to believe. It would be hard to come up with a solid genre for Return of the King because it is a drama, it is an action movie, it is a thriller, it is a romance, it even has it's moments of comedy. It goes, here, there, everywhere, and as Bilbo Baggins would say ""back again."""
"Ah, Lord of the Rings... that breath of fresh air that totally clenses the soul of bad book-to-film movies that plague cinema... the refreshing, cool drink of ice-cold-water in a dry desert of mediocrely directed bore-fests of fantasy... the massive intake of breath after a long and suffering plunge of *arrow flies by my head* WHAT THE Christ WAS THAT?!?!? Yes... Lord of the Rings is a story about long and taken-for-granted peace... then thrown into this awful world of total HOLY SH** moments that steal the show in a mad rush of battles and torment. And it rocks... all the way from dramatic beginning, to multiple end.... Its an incredible 9 to 11 and a half hours of pure bliss and wonder. A masterful achievement of modern cinima and a blast for everyone; Lord of the Rings has captured the souls of many people... and, judging from how good the movies are... the numbers are just gonna keep growing. Long live Lord of the Rings, Peter Jackson, Fran Walsh, The Weta Workshop Team, the cast of unbelievably awesome actors, and of course... Andy Serkis (WHO DESERVED THAT F***IN Oscar!!!!). Best movie of the 21st century... and one of the best movies of all time.... And its official... anyone who didn't like this movie is going to hell.... Just kidding. Thats for those guys at the Oscars who didn't nominate Andy Serkis."
"Peter Jackson has taken one of the great trilogies, and beautifully transferred it to the big screen. Return of the King is the conclusion of the trilogy. The trilogy ends on a very high note. It is beautifully shot, and the casting is one of the best jobs of casting I ever scene. Even when you look at some characters who are cast a little differently than in the books, it still works in Peter Jackson's interpretation. The art direction is also first rate. Peter Jackson has given this literary classic the epic feel it deserves. Return of the King is the fastest moving and best of the three, though all three are destined to be classics that will stand the test of time."
"Epic. What is this obsession with being 'epic'? The tedious sweeping shots of New Zealand countryside.The ridiculous, poorly constructed 'shakey cam' CGI battles. The endless 'rousing' speeches and cringe-worthy battle banter.I suppose the story of Lord of the Rings suggests all of these elements, so perhaps Peter Jackson is not entirely to blame. What it really comes down to is that this is a *bad* story. Middle Earth is under threat from what? An evil lighthouse that controls an army of orcs? This is supposed to be menacing? Give me a break. Even after the 'threat' is dispelled, the film continues at its torturous pace for 30 or so more minutes! I couldn't care less what happens to the people of Middle Earth. Not a single character is likable.Too sum up Lord of the Rings in a word: Boring. Very, very boring."
"This is one of the best fantasy films ever. The finale of all three films this is the type of ending any tale should have. A detailed triumph and it only worked because this was one huge 10 hour epic. This also launched the careers of many of it's tireless cast. This is similar to the star wars in mythic heroism. I'd suggest anyone, with the time to spare, to watch the films in order ( probably not in one sitting ) and be swept away to middle earth. But the finale is definitely the crowning jewel and the most exciting chapter. Action adventure films will judged against this film in the future.i shy away for a perfect score because of length and 1 story line i feel was dragged a little too long. but other then that it was an amazing accomplishment."
"Peter Jackson finally completes his epic tale, and what a tale it was. An unforgettable journey through middle earth comes to an end with the destruction of the one ring, and Sauron, the dark lord. The Age of men comes and the elves and the wizards leave the middle earth. That's just about what happens in the movie.But nothing can be expressed, about what the actual experience feels like, the fight on the fields of Gondor, the Rohan's armies war cry, it still fills me up, with emotion. It's just about perfect. I mean I literally cannot write anything about this movie, untoward. The special effects will be a benchmark for days to come, the score was mind blowing, the acting was stupendous, the screenplay, costumes, well, I'm running out of words to write in this review... It's a must watch for every man, woman or child capable for a movie going experience...A perfect 10/10..."
"This movie is the most inspiring piece of film-work I have seen in years. The beautiful movie-making by Mr. Peter Jackson was one worthy of robust applause and I salute him for his daring to be excellent and for give the Lord of the Rings books the best movie counterpart it could possibly have. When I first saw the movie in theaters, I felt slightly nervous at first to see what was going to appear on that screen, but it went beyond my expectations even though it still didn't contain all I wanted it too, I felt that Tolkien's masterpiece was payed the most proper respect with this movie. I love the complexities Jackson managed to weave into the story and how he really knows how to make a movie. I love the devotion and attention from all the people involved. You couldn't ask for anything better and the fact that they won all those Oscars makes me happy to see this marvelous movie recognized so wonderfully. When I watch this movie, it makes me feel awe and an overwhelming sense of hope for the next generation of movies. Any devoted Tolkien fan would be proud of this work."
"This is quite simply, the best movie ever made. Accept it. Everything about this movie is perfect. Everything. This is the only movie I've ever seen that I can truly say that about. If you haven't seen this movie, your missing out on the experience of a lifetime. Don't believe me? Will the the fact that it's tied for Most Oscar's Ever convince you? What about the fact that it's the fastest movie ever to gross 1 billion dollars? Sean Astin, Sir Ian McKellan, and EVERYONE else in this movie gives an absolutely phenomenal performance. The special effects are flawless, and even the moments of comic relief are impeccable. If you only see one movie this LIFETIME, make it this one. For the love of all that is good, make it this one."
"Peter Jacksons Best work so far! The depth in the relationship of the fellowship continues to fall apart as Frodo and Sam Reach their destination; I liked the sense of compassion between each of the characters although they weren't always with each other. Although the book is more Intriguing the way the screenplay was composed worked perfectly! This excellent work of art lives up to its reputation with its amazing 11 academy award winning Oscars! With more pain, suffering, and loss throughout the story, the actors deliver a powerful sense of their characters with their talents. In my opinion this is my favorite out of the three part trilogy!!!"
"OK, i agree, this movie is good. But why it's third movie on the list? And why it won an Oscar? I think that -for example- 'Mystic river' is definitely a better movie, with more moving act, more fantastic story and music. 'LOTR: The Return of The King' is overrated! I enjoyed it, but the technical side is most important in it. The story, and acting are, maybe not bad, but not excellent too. Cate Blanchett, Elijah Wood, Liv Tyler - they were almost wonderful, but other cast (with Mortensen on the top) weren't so 'unussual'. I appreciate Peter Jackson - he just did a good job.. nothing more. I recommend it, but people... it's not a greatest movie ever..."
"The first book I ever read for myself was the Hobbit. I was six years old. When I was eight I read The Lord of The Rings. As so many others I then read everything Tolkien wrote, including his letters. At least Twice a year for the next ten years I re-read LOTR. Now in my late thirties I still read it at least every other year, and have introduced my children. They are too young to watch the films, but I trust they will love them once they are old enough, and see Peter Jackson's genius for directing and his child like trust in the original story to present it as I imagined it all thoughts years ago. The third film provides the same sense of closure as the book, and leaves the viewer with no doubt that middle earth is part of our history, and as real a place in our minds and hearts as ancient Greece or medieval Britain.The acting and direction is almost perfect. Middle Earth exists as much in these films as it always has in our imaginations. The only disappointment is that at times in all three films the CGI demonstrates a level of slackness that is only identify able when compared to the amazing detail of attention given to these cinematic masterpieces.Do not just watch these films. Take time to live them. As you would with a good book, put the rest of life on hold, close the curtains and tell friends and family you are away. These films are to be enjoyed at relational depths, not just to pass several hours.Enjoy."
"Probably the most daunting cinematic achievement of all time, the trilogy represents the quintessential battle between good and evil. I can think of no other movie saga that captures the essence of adventure, drama, and storytelling that Lord Of The Rings accomplished.The brilliance in acting, cinematography, musical score, and dialogue yielded an amalgamation of art, that I have yet seen an equal.Truly a masterpiece in every sense of the word, and a Christmas gift for three straight years. I only hope that the studios bring to fruition The Hobbit, which would naturally complete the story. Amazing!"
"They were never going to get the books onto the screen, but the richness of what Peter Jackson has achieved means that the films stand up as first rate movie experiences in themselves. Lovers of the books have had their dreams realized and even Tolkien haters are hard put to deny the skill and artistry of the movie making. The effects are groundbreaking and breathtaking, as are the settings and costumes in unprecedented quantity and quality. The performances are good and in cases (McKellen, Mortensen, Bean) inspired, but beyond this the Lord of the Rings trilogy is a triumph of story, the power of the sort of tales that Tolkien studied from the oral traditions of ancient European cultures. It is in telling and sustaining a magnificent tale that the film makers most honour the work of Tolkien, even where they have cut and elided."
"This movie is a landmark in special-effects wizardry, and within the trilogy is easily the best (it's the only one with closure). I enjoyed almost every minute of this movie, but it is still not a top 10 movie by far.-Plotwise, it is a simple good vs. evil battle that we've all experienced before. Even though the story was written decades ago, and written quite well, it still doesn't have the depth. You can add characters and subplots to your heart's content, but the movie does not become deeper as a result, just more confusing to people that haven't read the books.-Besides war imagery that can possibly be connected to WWII, LOTR does not employ any symbolism, deeper meaning, not even a good authorial shot or coded dialogue. After finishing this trilogy, there is nothing else to think about - Not that this automatically makes a good movie, but it sure helps, and LOTR doesn't have any at all-The ending was long and drawn out. As soon as the main plot was resolved, the movie should have ended. The audience is instead treated to the hobbits dancing and giggling in slow-motion for another ten minutes.I really liked this movie. It was fun to watch, and it kept me entertained for 3 hours. It was definitely worth the $9. Still, this is not a top 10 movie, no matter how you want to phrase it."
"Lord of the Rings movies made me really excited when I saw them. The best one was the third part. It was so great and everyone acted so well in it. It is a great movie and I recommend that every Lord of the Rings fan, fans of adventure/horror/fantasy movies must see this one. Never miss your opportunity to see this one! I had my eyes glued to the screen until the end of the movie. You can't just miss a single second of this movie and I'm not exaggerating. It really deserved all those 11 Oscar awards. I'm happy that it bagged almost all the awards. On some scenes I was in hysterics. They didn't spoil the story at all. I saw it two times, by the way. I wouldn't mind to see it once more..."
"this movie is so beautiful and meaningful, every scene with Elijah Wood and Sean Astin is terrific and you will go to hell if you didn't cry when they're on mount doom or the end where Frodo leaves, this movie is a cinematic epic filled with wonderful effects, some of the best acting i have ever seen, Sean Astin deserved at least an Oscar nod, and Elijah Wood will soon win at one point, his eyes just tell you what he's feeling and whats he has been through,and Billy Boyd and Dominic Mohangan have finally grown out of their trouble making comic relief roles, this movie is not to be missed. also very good acting from Ian McKellen, Bernard Hill, Viggo Mortensen, and everybody else in he incredible cast."
"this film is simply the best, both of the trilogy and of this type of epic film making. before the LOTR films people had stopped making this type of epic. not only is the film a technical masterpiece, it also has a heart to it due to the quality of writing and the excellent performances from the actors, especially, Sean Astin, Viggo Mortenson, and Ian Mckellen. This is the only film that has caused me to leave the cinema speechless. Return of the king fully deserved all of the Oscars it won and should also have had nominations in the acting categories. i can't wait to see the extended version on DVD which i have got on order. the parts involving Christopher Lee will be very interesting to see."
"There is no better fantasy/adventure movie than the Lord of the Rings. All the elements of a good movie are placed in there fittingly to make a exceptional work of art. The action sweeps you off reality's base, the drama is beyond the level of some top drama movies, the emotions are well balanced and well acted out, the script is loyal to the book and everything works. The entire LOTR series in general, book and movie alike is my favorite fantasy work, and should be a favorite for many people who are fans of movies or books in general. If there is any movie that can compare to this work, it has not yet been shown on the big silver screen. The final outcome could truly be considered a classic."
"Going into this film, I was entirely oblivious as to what to expect. I found the first two ""Lord of the Rings"" films to be dazzling in action, if often stagnant in dialogue, and so my expectations for this film were high if not stratospherically high. Boy, was I surprised at how this wonderful, spectacular film surpassed any kind of expectation and kept me on the edge of my seat in almost its entire nearly three and a half hour run. Spellbinding, breathtaking, and with epic battle scenes more terrifying and engaging than any film of ""horror"" I have ever seen, this film succeeds on practically every level, as a certifiable masterpiece in film-making. The direction of Peter Jackson is sweeping and incredible in his infinite scope and articulation, among the most laudible and well-deserved Oscars I have ever admired. ""King""'s screenplay avoids the hollowness and gushiness of its predecessors, with the characters primarily speaking what is on their mind, particularly about the war against good and evil which is to be waged between man and orc. The music is every bit as astounding as the original ""Rings"", portentous to the various moods of action and drama throughout the film, supplying plenty suspense, exhilaration, and overall life to the film, a most essential component of the tone of the film. Visual effects: what can I say? Awesome and mind-blowing, the best of the trilogy and possibly the best of the history of cinema. Gollum as insidious and enjoyable as ever! Breathtaking scenery, magnificent art-set direction, and the complements could extend forever... A truly beautiful, stupendous masterpiece of a film, a leviathan of nearly every aspect of cinema, and the best film of 2003 by far. Generally, a movie trilogy is prone to tremendous declination as it proceeds, yet ""Rings"" merely inclines to the end, stratospherically. It is everything you would want in a movie, and a sensationally excellent film! **** out of ****"
"LOTR have been the best movies I have ever seen. The books were great and could not be entirely duplicated on the big screen, but Peter Jackson did a wonderful job! If you haven't seen it, go today! Pretty soon the entire trilogy will be available on DVD and you will be able to watch it in the privacy of your own home.Note that it was the film that won the Oscars and not the actors. That says volumes in itself. Most of the actors were unknown prior to this movie, but they all did a wonderful job. The special effects and animations were terrific and Tolkien's story line is just great.I would suggest that you read the books even if you won't watch the movie. I read them a long time ago and was enthralled by them. You will see Middle Earth in an entirely new way. Also, read The Hobbit."
"I was a huge fan of the LotR books, and also of the LotR films 1 and 2. But in part 3 Peter Jacksons old hobbies shine through the fabric of the film much to clearly. After the action is ended, the audience is washed away in at least half an hour of ever increasing emotional (tear jerking) scenes, that - because they are pilled up this way irritate instead of emotionate. A total lack of subtlety, or respect for the audience for that matter. Quite a disappointment after the a beautiful beginning in part 1 and 2."
"I am not a big scifi/fantasy movie fan, but i really enjoyed the first two LOTR movies, and expected this one to be even better. What a let down. This movie lacked any real acting, or character development. I found myself nearly snoring at the neverending battle scenes. It might have been a great movie if it had been reduced to 2 hours, but this movie seemed to never end."
"i love this movie so much because it has every criteria of becoming a successful movie that  i want in a single film.first,the movie has provided an excellent characters development.second, it has a very brilliant story plots.third, it represented an outstanding special effects.last but not less,the movie has a superb music score."
Best Movie Ever.....whats with that fruity orgy at the end? Gallum is sweet. Samwise is sweet.  Rudy Rudy Rudy....Gandalf is sweet.  Legolas is sweet. Aragorn is sweet.  Killing Elephants is sweet. Aerosmith is sweet.  If you didnt like this movie you are bad at watching movies and shouldnt watch anything but dongs in blenders.  Sweet Movie.
"This was an okay film. Well, it would have been good if about 20% was edited from every scene. 3 hrs 20 mins for this? And parts of the end were even in slow motion like finally ending this thing was a tease. At least give me an intermission.The first two were far better as there was actual character interaction. I recall laughing in the other films. I laughed only once during this one. ROTK felt like a giant Dragonball Z show or Pro wrestling where there's all this build up to battles with big talk and grand epic shots. Too much ""it's going to be a tough battle"" lines and no real characters. Where was the Legolas/Dwarf banter for example? And my lord, please I can't possibly watch so many scenes of people with tears and smiling at each other with swooshing crescendos in the background score.There was so much heavy-handed love for your fellow man in this that it seemed like a middle earth It's A Wonderful Life."
"I first read LOTR in 1975. At the time (and after subsequent readings) my one disappointment was that there was no way anyone could possibly do justice to such a fantastic literary work on the big screen. 28 years on and it is such a wonderful feeling to have been proven wrong.I was priviledged to attend the world premier in Wellington, and feel it isn't really within my ability to express in words how truly great ROTK is - suffice to say this film benchmarks ""epic"" for the next decade and will be the yardstick by which all others of this scale are measured.Whether you are a long standing Tolkien fan, or a recent convert with the release of the previous two episodes, this film will not disappoint - on the contrary, it will take you to places few other (if any) films have. Peter Jackson and his crew have remained faithful to the storyline (probably more so than with the original releases of FOTR and TTT) and I would implore that the malcontent who are critical of the omissions set aside their misgivings to make the viewing of this film as enjoyable for themselves as it most assuredly will be for the vast majority. There is always the extended version to look forward to for the hardcore Tolkienites.I only hope for their sakes that when the Oscars come around the Academy members reward Jackson the outsider and his team appropriately for one of the greatest productions in cinema history - failure to do so would leave the voters appearing ridiculous, and the awards ceremony itself an irrelevant sham."
"This is one of the greatest fantasy films in cinematic history. The fact that it reached new heights in visual effects and was able to win the academy award for Best Picture including all the categories it was nominated for shows a great deal to filmmakers. It is perfect in every sense of glory, majestic outlook, breathtaking feel, vibratory and thrilling new sights. Peter Jackson is a filmmaker that is very keen on looking at an image and acknowledging how beautiful it is. There is no sense of doubt or false pleasure or even pessimistic ideals towards this piece of craft. It is a satisfying conclusion to one of the greatest film series in Hollywood history and is certainly a victorious accomplishment."
"Amazing film! Based on a great book story. Despite being populated with wizards, elves, dwarfs, and trolls, Lord of the Rings has more in common with epic films like Ben Hur or The Ten Commandments than it does with the comparatively small-scale mild adventurism that is the likes of Harry Potter. This is a film of contrast and familiarity. Contrast it its landscapes, from the comfortable, sweetly beautiful landscapes of Hobbiton, to the dark and disturbing dangers of deeply delved Moria, to the majestic, breathtaking tree homes of Lothlorien and the elves. Familiarity in it's characters, brought together by the fickle scales of fate, desperately balancing their lives against evil for the greater good. It's also a movie about struggle and determination, as the smallest and meekest of creatures enters a world far beyond their experience. Best trilogy ever!"
"This is a review of the trilogy. Doesn't faithfully follow the book - why should it, it's a film - but carries it's essence throughout. Across the 12 hours (extended versions) there's very little to criticise really. Using John Rhys Davies (who plays Gimli) as the voice of Treebeard wasn't a great idea and in the parting to the Grey Havens (end of 3) the hobbit stand-ins are really awful - you just know they're kids - I'm amazed they didn't see fit to shoot it better. I suppose a Scottish & American accent, both from The Shire, well, you soon get used to it. The acting is top rate and the special effects, at the time of production/cinema release, are stunning. This is a score of 9.75 for the trilogy to me.Incidentally, if you can, check out the BBC Radio play version of LOTR directed by Brian Sibley, it's fantastic."
"Where do i begin ? I am not an articulate writer so please bear with me, i have seen many, many movies in my time, different languages, genres and themes.There are good movies, bad movies and indifferent ones.But there are few master pieces, and even fewer modern ones, and Return of the King is a true master-piece of cinema.It would be a truly cold person that would not be touched by the characters in these 3 films and it doesn't matter that it is set in a fantasy environment as in all films if we cannot relate with the characters then there is no soul in the screen. Everone involved in ROTK is at the top of their game and the Academy where spot on to award all the 'gold guys' that were on offer to them. It does have it flaws maybe ( soem say the ending was a bit drawn out) but hey , why would you want to leave middle earth when you love being in this place.Thank You to Peter Jackson and co for filling my heart with wonder once more i look at the silver screen !"
"Sorry but I'm not a fan. Years ago I tried reading the Hobbit but got bored by chapter 2. The first film was so so pedestrian and plodding and dare I say boring?? I saw the second on DVD such was the lack or exceitment, for me, caused by the first one.The second was little better and the third although the best of the lot is surely not THAT good??  Undoubtadly a brave production and full credit to Peter Jackson and co, awesome special effects, excellent acting but I just find this whole hobbity elf wizard thing SO BORING. It was like the Phantom Menace all that quasi neo religious clap trap was such a let down compared to the first Star Wars that I haven't bothered seeing the one about the clones and the third one."
"This movie dragged on for what seemed like six hours.  The primary battle scenes are fantastic and a worthy final chapter to the story.  Of course, all three movies dragged on seemingly endlessly with uninteresting hobbit conversation and bickering.I rate this movie a ""3"" due to a 3 hr 21 minutes of mostly boredom for me. If it had been half that long...I'd rate it a ""6"" for being a very interesting story with great effects."
"How can anyone who has read the books think this is a good adaptation? The liberties taken with the story were almost forgivable in the previous two movies, but The Return of the King is just hogwash in my view. It's a shame that Fran Walsh and Peter Jackson succumbed to the trend to Hollywoodize everything adapted for the big screen. Major disappointment."
"Many people commented that more than three hours passed by when the movie finished.  It's not hard to explain: just note how slow the people speak, always rendered in a Hollywood-heroic form; or otherwise it seems that they are acting under influence.  Other moments, they just gaze at each other, or the landscape, and then the epic-ish (Irish?) music starts.  The movie could be compressed to 90 minutes.  And still, three hours aren't enough for a decent portrait of the personalities: the good guys talk like saints, the evil ones like worms.The plot is the same old one: people run around to fight the evil and save the world, with every episode looking like the end of the world.  The visual effects of the fighting scenes are exceptional, but it is not dissimilar to a combination of Jurassic Park & Last Samurai & The Eruption of Mt St Helen.Probably a good preparation step to the Ring Cycles."
"How can a well-made adventure like RETURN OF THE KING beso numbingly dull?It's hard to fault the production design and special effects -- everyinch of the widescreen palate is filled with colorful imagery. Inaddition, the cast acquits itself well, even though they're stuck withstilted and annoying faux Middle English dialog. Ultimately, thewhole thing is so stiff and scripted that it comes off as lifeless,even as castles fall to the ground and thousands of creatures die.Maybe its least forgiving fault is the ending. Well, it's not quite anending, because it never ends; it's one coda after another, andsnickers could be heard from my otherwise reverent first dayaudience as the film refused to die. A great cinematic achievement? Peter Jackson's achievement isonly technical, and I'm relieved that there aren't any more volumesin the trilogy."
"Several points that I agree with:1.  Characters and story are dull, hence... 2.  I lose interest and lose track of who's fighting whom and why 3.  People take this way too seriously 4.  On a technical level, the film is very well done and impressive to look at, but ultimately, it never involves you emotionally unless you are taking it too seriously, hence... 5.  This is one of the most overrated movies of all-time to be up at #4 on this list."
"you people are so comic it makes me batty. is it a good movie.....yes. was it a brilliantly imagined and epic series of films.......yes. was it one of the best 50 films of all time.......NOT A CHANCE IN HELL.i don't care if you 15 year olds want to live in fantasy land the rest of your lives but spare us from this ""LOTR are the best movies ever crap"" we don't need to hear it and it makes us laugh. it was a great series to watch but when you come on here and disrespect the film greats of all time and have any of these LOTR movies in the top 100 it disrespects the entire film industry. if you want to play fantasy time then go on a Disney board and post away. but do us all a favor and leave the IMDb for real movies."
"Without the use of computer graphics, this film would not be worth the price of a cheap bargain day 3 for 1 special rental at the local video store. True the locations and cinematography add to the film, however, heaven forbid that the cast should either have to act, or in the case of the veteran actors, overact! CG removed, and this thespian (in name only) grouping are woefully short of the depth and quality characterization brought forth in the classic book. The direction is sporadic, and the pace is inconsistent, leaving little to the imagination why so much of the budget was spent on computer technicians instead of acting lessons. Sorry for all those who jumped on the lemming band wagon for this one, but, lift your heads above middle earth and return to the land of the living."
"A great film, sorely let down by the ending. I know Jackson is only trying to stick to Tolkien's version but the ending was unsuited for a film. It just dragged on and on and on. It really soured my experience of what otherwise was a great trilogy. The interminable ending should have been resigned to a Director's Cut DVD version to satisfy Tolkien fans.The worst ending ever? A.I. of course :)"
"wat the hell is good about this movie? its too streched out, silly, stupid ending, every second you think its going to end but NOOOOOOOOOO one more scene to go...too long for nothing, 3 hours can be smidged into an hour and a half...the pervious 2 are much better...that film is SOSOSOSOSOS OVERRATED its pathetic"
"I had heard that this was the best of the three. I thought the first one was very good, and the second one almost as good. So, why was I nodding off during the final episode? For one thing, the story isn't all that interesting. Characters abound but there is little depth to most of them, despite the extravagant amount of time available for character development. And really, yet another orc siege on a human stronghold, with a flimsy subplot about a father attempting to burn his not-quite-dead son. Nothing really new or interesting to add to the previous two episodes. I don't know which are more boring, the elves or the ghost army. And don't get me started about the extended epilogue. Pointless.I apologize to the many true believers, but this movie is a bloated, boring, anticlimactic conclusion to the series. The three films as a whole provide a decent adaptation of trilogy. Unfortunately, the concluding episode only detracts from those that came before."
"A few years ago, I was into really gory horror films (still am now), and one that I saw was braindead. I thought it was brilliant and funny, and the direction was superb - it was my best movie ever. Fast forward to the year 2000, and I read this story - the lord of the rings. I loved the book, I was 20 at the time, and heard that the film was coming out - and guess who was directing it - the director of my favourite film ever - Braindead - yep, it was peter Jackson. I was a wee bit excited, to say the least, and the film didn't disappoint. The direction is the same style as braindead - novel approaches and amusing angles, but I was worried it wouldn't be taken seriously due to Peter Jacksons' previous films. I find the films very close to the book - though not exactly as the books are (Tom Bombadil being someone who should have been included in FOTR).The Special effects are superb, and you can tell the actors enjoyed making the film. I love all the films, and give them a worthy 10/10. Well done Mr. Jackson!!!!"

"...in fact, nothing in common with the holy book...even on the contrary - everything that i thought was inviolable was taken and torn to pieces...DON'T WATCH IT! DON'T DO THAT MISTAKE! I mean if you like the book...if you like nowadays commercial junk movies go and watch it - it's one of the best!"
"This isn't actually a review of this movie but a review of the top 100 movies list here. Obviously, if the majority of users on IMDb rate Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King as the 4th best movie ever, there either aren't many users over 14 or the majority of users know very little about good film making. I'm sure I could easily come up with 100 movies that are better than all 3 Lord of the Rings movies. That's really all I wanted to say is that by rating LOTR as one of the best movies ever, you're proving to the world how useless this site is for knowledgeable critical movie reviews. How can one take the ratings on this site seriously after having realized that LOTR is the #4 best movie ever according to IMDb users!"
"Without effects this movie will be nothing People you wants a cinema full of effects? in this effects you find some feelings? The only reason for this movie is money for the money. The movie is awful, the director sucks, Jackson is a puppet, sorry mister Jackson maybe you are good person (i don't think so , because you want to full your pockets and buy some pools ) Hollywood must close, is industry that puts poison in people minds and hearts. All that things is not for the art but for the money. Shame on Hollywood.Lord 1, lord 2 and lord 3 is for person with 3 years old minds, i prefer to read the books. The votes on IMDb is fake, wake up !! The world must wake up is the only solution for this awful cinema, but how?"
"10 out of 10! The world of film-making can be as complex as the stars, just ask any good producer/director. However as a viewer, film conveys the power of storytelling nothing else can match. And when movies are as good as the ""Rings"" films are, the power of story becomes timeless--past, present, future, are all embodied, the life-force is revealed, the human soul is enriched and evolves. Such are the Rings'.I hope everyone has a chance to experience these highest examples of what film has to offer the human experience. Peter Jackson is a master, bringing all the elements together as only a master can: story, sets, editing, photography, actors, music, lighting, costumes, and most of all, directing."
"All the Lord of the Rings movies are over rated. I think there are much better movies out there, and people care too much about these stupid movies. Nothing all that great happens, the acting is okay, the landscape is pretty to look at, but the story is boring. I just feel that these movies are way to popular for what they are, or should I say what they are not. If you have seen these movies more than 3 times, get a life. If you know most of the lines in the movies, get a life. Movies are for enjoyment, they should not be a lifestyle. And most of the people who really likes these movies, let their obsessions rule their lives. So once a again, get a life. These movies are not that great."
"Come on people, relax. This was a visually stunning movie, which beautifully portrayed middle earth. But please, #3 all time. The acting is average at best. Orlando Bloom and Elijah Wood make me shutter every time they open their mouths. The best actor in this movie was Sean Astin, who thus far has gone unrecognized. This is a very good movie, I agree, but not the third best, and certainly not better than godfather II. Lets all take a deep breath, relax, and then rank it where it belongs."
"I can't believe how many people gave this movie a 10! Alright, this movie has got a great cast, very good special effects and it's filmed on great locations. But there are just so many cliche's (is that how you spell it?) in this movie, it just p***ed me off. Every time some hero is just about being killed, a friend turns up and kills the Orc. Every single time! In the last part alone this happened about five times. A lot of the dialoges are very crappy, predictable and cliche. Many things are just plain copied from Braveheart (a movie that is a lot better than the LOTR movies). The great casting and special effects alone could not give this movie a 10! I gave it a 7. There are other movies that are much much better and more original than the LOTR movies that should deserve a higher rating. Once this Lord Of The Rings hype is over, I hope people will come to their sences. When you watch it on TV it's not great at all."
"My lord, what a mawkish slab of overwrought merde. No medium shots here, just washed out and incoherent long shots of battle and close up after close up of meaningful lip quivering as the music deafens all theater goers with the more dramatic strains of what seems to have been borrowed from Stargate. And what is with the weepers in the audience? This is worse than the previous two films."
"Very boring film, good effects but not 100% by book. A long and boring film with special effect, nothing more. Other parts have the same issue. Its like spider-man or transformers, good idea but a sh*** film. So if u have enough time, I think about 12 hours for whole trilogy and crap Hobbit and u can waste your time for this then go ahead."
"AS the first two movies, Peter Jackson did a great job directing, filming and editing the movie.However, the strong defaults of the original books show up, being too much of a too simplistic (anglo-saxon) battle of good against evil with characters lacking subtlety and finesse and, overall, lacking richness.As for the actors, Mortensen and Bean are very good but Orlando Bloom exhibits once again his usual remarkable lack of presence.Overall, great image and edition and just above average cast, put together to support an initial story offering a good entertainment value but lacking subtlety, deepness and richness."
"I have seen this movie a total of 5 times. Three times in Theatre. This has to be the best movie ever. From the first when Frodo, Sam and Gollum wake up in a cave and continue with their Journey, to the end when Gollum and Frodo battle each other for the ring. If i had the chance, i would watch this movie again.I recommend this movie to anyone that loves medieval type stuff.Paul WardI give this movie a rating of 9/10!Thanks for reading. :)Oh, and this movie has the best visuals i have ever seen in a movie. The best acting.. the best everything. Thank you Peter Jackson for such a great movie!"
"Dull, Inadequate Finale.From it's start, you sense the drawn-out nature of this supposedly epic ending... its all over the place, trying to involve you with the tedious ""now's a good time to go out for popcorn!"" fluff/added-on characters who obviously serve only to pad the whole sequence of events.Peter Jackson heard that trilogies were trendy, so he decided to milk the audience for 3 films, when 2 would have been much more concise.Really, he could have had a very tight and meaningful 2-pat LOTR, but unnecessarily watered it down to make us spend the extra $9 to be bored on the long route to the predictable conclusion.It upsets me that the DVD's are so full of extra's. What ever happened to Editing? Keeping the theme tight? Concise work w/o crappy filler?"

"This movie was awful for me first and foremost because it did not draw me in to the story, for only seconds at a time did I care for or could I make sense of the story and the acting, I was simply bored and restless. And the directing was awful. The cinematography boring and predictable. The editing confusing. The score predictable. The storyline infantile. The acting, without any exception TERRIBLE. The lenght insane. The events too much for fantasy. The CGI effects hokey. It is a childs movie a la Jungle book. It belongs on Nickelodeon between Spongebob and Johnny Bravo. In fact, there oughta be a law against Peter Jackson movies."
"Sorry, but how can people rate this movie so high? It's the worst of the 3 in this trilogy and definitely not an Oscar movie in any way. I enjoyed the trilogy to some extent and read the books as a teen but this movie was a huge disappointment. Please be warned if you want to watch this, it's sooooo long you prob need to watch it over multiple days to bear it."
Its Very Good movie but if some one watch this movie need to be watch previous parts. if you watch this part you don't understand movie plot you must watch its previous parts. which was released in 2002 and so on. its adventure and interesting movie. if you want to watch movie for weekend that's you can select this movie.
My all time favorite trilogy. I have watched this trilogy more than 10 times. It's been my favorite movie sequence since my childhood. The war strategies they used in this trilogy was excellent. The reason for liking this was the way the way the movie runs. I've watched the Hobbit trilogy too after this. I've even read the books of these movies. an applaud to the Writer and the Director of these movies. I wish that another trilogy of this movie sequence would come one day. The most favorite character of mine in this movie was Legolas. I love the way he fights. There is are few humour too in this movie from the beginning till the end. I would recommend everyone to watch all the six movies in both the trilogies.
"This trilogy was Peter Jackson's masterpiece. The final installment had some of the most epic fight sequences in the trilogy while keeping a good blend between dark atmospheric tone and light comedic moments. Though, there was a finale of ending proving (if the Hobbit trilogy did not) that Peter Jackson loves making middle earth movies. I doubt that this movie is for everyone because it is less main stream than many other Sci-Fi movies like the Star Wars Saga but, for me, that means more depth and explanation into the mythological world set. Overall, a great trilogy with about 7 satisfying ending in one movie. Although, this trilogy also is the reason I suffered through immense pain watching 8 hours of the Hobbit so, in that case it is a win-lose scenario."
"I can watch this trilogy over and over again. It makes me want to live in that world as well. It's so good. I mean i do not have anything negative to say about it. it's amazing. i am sort of waiting on the movie of the silmirallion, although i think there will never be a movie about this. Maybe for the better. The hobbit was maybe slighter less than this trilogy, but amazing as well. All the characters play their roll so well. I think its a film suitable for everyone. If you do not like fantasy, this movie will make you like fantasy. I'm serious. i think this is the best fantasy film ever made, if not so, the best movie. Its so sad jrr Tolkien is not anymore amongst us. he is a legend, just like jk rowling. the world has some serious talented people, right?"
"so... i will don't write a lot because all know to blame. the movies lord of the rings was the most exciting series in world, i see all 6 movies (including the hobbit) 2-3 time on year because is my favorite series , and will remain my favorite, since the beginning the story was amazing, i mean, a world when the technology doesn't exist, but the magic, dragons, or enchanted items are, this is amazing, that type of story is my favorite, i hope will be more movie based on this story, because is one of greatest series. second think is the landscapes, i mean there's a lot of landscapes everywhere but in this movie are just amazing, i think was very very hard to make a great movie like this, but this is just... perfect."
"Watching this movie for the first time I thought it was a great adaptation of the series. I was drawn in by the dynamic visuals and story line. I love the Lord of the Rings serious and was not disappointed after watching this continuation of the series. I also love the action sequences in the film and the special effects creations like Gollum, who appears real on the screen. The final battle scene is also a magnificent piece in the movie which allows the viewer an up close and personal encounter to action taking place. As they emerge on the city with a battering ram, I was drawn into the scene as it was unfolding and was in total amazement as the imagination of the writer was captured on the screen."

"I just love The Lord of the Rings and this one is amazing. I recommend this movie to anyone and everyone! It is adventurous, heart-warming, and a tear-jerker. It is definitely the best way to end the trilogy. I cried so much but it was wonderful and I will never forget it. I love anything that has to do with The Lord of the Rings and this movie completely changed my life. The Lord of the Rings is such a wonderful story, full of love, friendship, action, and hope. I am reading the books, too, and I think that all three of these movies follow the storyline very well. I just know that anyone who will watch these movies will love it. Of course I recommend reading the books first!"
"the best movie i've seen. The final battle for Middle-earth begins. Frodo and Sam, led by Gollum, continue their dangerous mission toward the fires of Mount Doom in order to destroy the One RingThe Lord of the Rings is an epic high fantasy novel written by English philologist and University of Oxford professor J. R. R. Tolkien. The story began as a sequel to Tolkien's 1937 children's fantasy novel The Hobbit, but eventually developed into a much larger work. It was written in stages between 1937 and 1949, much of it during World War II.[1] It is the second best-selling novel ever written, with over 150 million copies sold"
"I think they did a good job with the last movie. Often with in movie series, the quality just sinks with each movie that comes out, but with Lord of the Rings i really think they found a way to avoid that. I am a huge fan of the books and the films really was a good surprise, where movie adaption of books usually disappoints, i was really surprised. Everything was just great, not only with this movie, but with all of them. Music, locations, actors and dialog. Peter Jackson is a world class director and with these movies i really feels that he shows that. Everything was great. Recommend to check out the movies and would encourage everyone to try the books."
"Loved the historical anecdotes, graphics and general tightness of the storyline, quite an enthralling watch. Great movie one of the best trilogies of all time. The acting was impeccable and a lot of humor to spice up the action. The movie basically pops your eyes, excites your senses and brings you in as close as a whisper for scenes of startling emotion. Not only has Jackson boldly and faithfully brought J.R.R. Tolkien world to life, he's created the most epic and sweeping fantasy adventure of all time. One thing though the movie is both the longest film in the series and the most confidently paced, striking an ideal balance of combat and camaraderie."
"Peter Jackson is absolutely amazing! No matter what Peter Jackson is working on, you can be sure to see excellent craftsmanship. Lord Of The Rings seems to be a placed where everyone would like to visit. From the Elvish language, that everyone wanted to learn to speak. Due to the eloquence when the actors spoke. Right down to the amazing sets. He is able to take you into a world beyond your expectations. The actors did a wonderful job in bringing their characters to life. Each actor was dedicated to portraying their characters. The costumes were wonderfully designed, making one want to be apart of this magical world and who wouldn't want to live in the Shire. I recommend seeing Lord Of The Rings. You will not be disappointed. It was beyond the minds expectations."
"It was a great movie. I would love to play a part in it! I am a huge fan of all of the Lord of the rings. I love how each one leaves you wanting more. You can't stop at just one. You must keep going... It's infectious It's got plenty of mystery,love,friendship,battles,magic It's really just a great set. Good verses evil as most movies have but SO much more,I am a die hard fan of Lord of the rings ALL of them and that is including the new Hobbit is awesome!!!!!!!! I can not wait to see the next one! I will be at the theater as soon as it comes out!!!!!!!! Everything i imagined as a small girl comes to life in these movies. It's such a beautiful fantasy,adventure movie for every child and adult who has an imagination."

This movie was one of the best I have seen. The graphics were great. The way they put the whole movie together was just awesome. I loved watching every second of it. The first time I watched it I watched it three times in a row because I couldn't get enough of the movie. The lord of the rings series is just amazing in itself. What they have to go through with the ring and what they have to fight and figure out on the way there. I absolutely loved this movie. One that will definitely go down in the history books as an amazing movie. I think everyone should see this movie and the others before and after it. They might feel the same way that I do about it. I LOVE IT!!!
"There is no shortage to say that Peter Jackson and his staff of creators and actors have left its mark in the history of visual story telling for as long as time shall go.History will continue to revile this gem of our time, and I feel lucky to be part of its birth and continuation to fill the hearts of love for films. Its visual achievements stand proud even ten years down the evolution of movie crafting, and Howard Shore delivers a score which will define brilliance in motion picture soundtracks.It is truly one of the rare films I watch dearly once a year, and still gives me chills, smiles and touch the deep heartstrings I so seldom touch in real life.It is a reminder of the beauty in life, and that darkness is but a passing no matter how great. It is indeed a movie which is pro-life; no matter what your struggles may be in life.This film is part of my childhood, now in my adult hood and hopefully something dear I can share with my children and their children. Until we all voyage into the west."
"Where do I even begin with The Lord of the Rings Trilogy? It is one of the finest film trilogies to ever make it to the big screen. Peter Jackson was admittedly an unexpected choice of director for the trilogy. Before Lord of the Rings, he made The Frighteners, Bad Taste, Meet the Feebles, and Heavenly Creatures. Heavenly Creatures was his first step out of absurd cinema, and then after The Frighteners came out in 1996, The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring was released in 2001 and became a critical, commercial and prestigious success. The Two Towers had the same success in 2002, and finally The Return of the King came and was the greatest of The Lord of the Rings Trilogy, and the first ever fantasy movie to win the Academy Award for Best Picture, and went on to win the BAFTA for Best Film and The Golden Globe for Best Picture - Drama.The Return of the King won all these awards for the right reasons. It was epic, gorgeous, a story that has been told consistently great from start to finish, and everything works. Lord of the Rings is one of those tales that will live on forever and ever. J.R.R. Tolkien would be extremely proud, even if his son, Christopher, isn't proud of the movies.The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King will be remembered and still be considered one of the finest movies ever made. An achievement on an epic cinematic level and a cultural milestone."
"On a Winter's weekend, when I was Six, my family and I, having not seen a LOTR film before, watched the Trilogy. And yes, it deserves a capital. Then, I watched it for the battles, the epic battles. Now, I watch it for the story, nostalgia and, of course, the battles.I have watched each of the Trilogy many, many times. I've watched them in the car on an old portable DVD player that only lasted two hours and I've watched them on each of the three TVs my family has owned in the last nine years. I've grown up with the films and the games of the films, the top trumps, and the knock-offs of the films. Nothing can replicate the plot or the spectacle, I know, but something to remind me of them is enough. And I am therefore finally reading the booksYes, I'm looking forward to the Hobbit trilogy (note, no capital, not yet at least.) but I am always looking back at LOTR."
"I cant even describe how good this movie is! But i guess i have to try.Voice acting: Superb. Peter Jackson really made this movie a good one in this category.Visual effects: The best part of the whole movie! The effects are amazing! The budget really helped make the effects great.Story: I have never read the book, but if this movie was this good in story, i will go straight for the book! The story is paced perfectly!Overall: I give this a 10/10. This is a film i recommend to everyone, but i can't imagine somebody not seeing this movie already!So go see this movie on DVD or extended edition! It doesn't really matter which one you want to get."
"At the lord of the rings movie Peter Jackson has chosen the best places to film it, the most suitable way to make it, and (the most serious) the most suitable cast for it. With his work not only he has made the best movie ever, but also he gave a Chance to the unknown members of the cast for a better future. an other good thing in this movie is that everything is real (because of Peter).For example: the Shire is one real village somewhere in new Zealand made from the lord of the rings crew. After trying for one year to make the village the result was the best. Also, all the things made for the movie such as swords, helmets,building miniatures, and other little things are selling to many movie shops. I am the fun no.:1000000345"
"Peter Jackson, in his artistic, is able to created the single greatest masterpiece of a movie that I have ever witnessed.Everything about this movie staggered my imagination. The actors (McKellen, Mortenson, WOod, Aston, etc.) are able to portray their respective characters that Tolkein described to perfection. Furthermore, the directing, sound, costumes, and effects all combined with each other to create an unprecedented masterpiece. Only two movies (Shawshank Redemption and Forrest Gump), in my mind, compete with the genius of The Return of King. What separates LOTR from other films, though, is its success in converting a fantasy into, not only a mainstream smash, but an eleven Oscar-winning film. For these reasons, I immensely enjoyed this truly unique epic."
"The lord of the rings is without a doubt the greatest film ever madethe acting, the effects, the scenery, the music, the directing..when i was heading for the theatre with my brother i knew what i was expecting, I was right. i went out of the theatre feeling a great deal of emotion.and frankly if was living now in the 50s, i would have agreed with what Tolkien said after the release of the books when he said that no one could make a film out of this. at the time obviously that would be true but then came SIR peter Jackson and created something so incredibly special.so to make a long story shortthe LOTR is the without a doubt the Best 11 HR AND 21 MIN movie of all time!!! A++++10/10"
"I agree to what shane has mentioned on city of god being a better contender for best pic. than return of the king.What I've realized by reading many comments on movies is that most of the critics just like to hammer and talk bad about a good film. maybe they want to feel special about them selves.Rarely you would come across a fair comment which explains the positive and negative aspects of a movie with an open mind.Nevertheless lotr is a great achievement in epic film making... level of creativity, innovation of vfx, the budget, making 3 films in a row, challenges of marketing etc. etc. + the level of acting compared to a huge movie like star wars is far better in all three movies.Peter jackson is one ,man after all....!He did a enjoyable movie for every one who admires the fantasy genre...."
"I just finished watching the 4 hour extended version of this epic motion picture. It was entirely different than the theatrical version, and I'll add that it was all the more better. If you enjoyed the book, the extended version brings you that much closer to the magic that was Tolkien's finest piece of fiction.See this movie, but definitely in order of the Trilogy, otherwise you'll be drowned in the scope of events. It could stand alone, but with such mastery it can be better appreciated with the background that is portrayed in The Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers.I, for one, can't wait until The Hobbit is immortalized as a timeless classic like this on the big screen."
"The entire Lord of the Rings movie trilogy is a complete travesty. I read these books when I was very young (I'm 24 now) and after watching the movies and seeing the new covers for the books, my disappointment was heightened. One of the major purposes of any work of fiction is to exercise the imagination in the form of creating images of the things in the work, especially the characters. Now, when someone reads these books after watching the movies (even The Hobbitt) the reader will have a preset image of the characters that they've seen. The Lord of the Rings is one of history's greatest series of fictional books simply because of the imagination put forth in creating an entire world to base it on; that's now basically ruined because of the movies. A good comparison would be the Dune series, which I now feel uncomfortable reading simply because I saw the Sci-fi channels presentations of the book and Children of Dune. The only reason that the movie deserves a 4 is because of the quality of it."
"I absolutely adore this movie, it is my favourite film of all time.The acting on all parts is superb, flawless and acted with so much emotion on all parts, when required.My favourite race of middle earth are the hobbits, played by ian holm, billy boyd, sean astin, dominic monaghan and elijah wood. Excellent choices for the roles.I prefer the movies to the books as you can relate more to them and understand where Tolkien was coming from in his writing.Roll on ""The Hobbit"" hopefully directed by Peter Jackson, just have to wait and see.."
i like a lot of people in the world are am a lord of the rings freak. i love these movies and the first two were amazing so return of the king had a lot to live up to. Ending the trilogy this movie is action packed with your massive fighting scenes to the touchy feeling parts. This movie will go down as one of the greatest in film history. Peter Jackson has shown that he is an amazing director through the lord of the rings trilogy and i strongly strongly encourage you to start with the beginning and work your way to the final film. It is quite hard not to spoil parts of the movie so i will refrain from doing so...but you seriously must check this movie out because it will blow your mind away with how amazing it is. Watch it and become a Lord of the Rings fanatic like me and millions of others.
Aragorn...should have been someone with a different voice...although I think he did an excellent job....he just sounds like Mike Tyson. The only other one I didn't like was the guy who played Faramir...good actor...did a decent job with the role...but just didn't fit what I imagined when I read the book. Just wondering what others think. Was anyone else upset that they totally left out Tom Bombadil? There was some other inconsistencies too. But mainly petty stuff. Overall I was super impressed with Jackson's vision of Middle Earth. Oh yeah...I really didn't like Cate Blanchette for Galadriel either. I hate to be mean but she isn't beautiful enough to play an elf. Or rather she has different kind of beauty than I imagined the elves to have. She is pretty just not the way the elves are pretty.
"I would like to say that in all of the trilogys of my generation this has been one of the best. The Return Of The King left nothing out. Everyone in the movie had there ending leaving the audience closure. Closure is something you don't get out of most movies, most of them leave you hanging, guessing. This movie made sure that after everything was over that you knew what happened to these characters at the end of all things.Of corse we can not forget the brilliant acting and amazing special effects we came to expect from the first two movies! I've seen all 3 movies 6 times. I know I giving this movie a great review and you are wondering why I only gave it an 8 out of 10. Well I'll tell you. I said that this was a perfect ending to the greatest epic of my time. There is another great epic that was made before my time that in my point of view surpasses The Lord of the Rings (your gonna laugh) The Return Of The Jedi gets my 10 out of 10. It's a better story. It's a better trilogy in my opinion, but that's just my opinion."
"like I wrote in my summary: I didn't like the movie because it was too long-winded. if it would have a duration time of about 1 hour and 45 minutes I would have probably given it a 8 or higher. it's the same with the other parts of this trilogy, all were too long. I think I liked the first one the most because of the new characters and a relative fast storyline. I never read the book, maybe that's why I was bored watching this movie.... I have had a discussion with a friend once, he liked it very much, he gave it an 9 or 10 but he has read the book, he told me that it was a great translation to the big screen, I can't compare it in that way. action, atmosphere creation and characters were excellent though!"
"Why does everybody like this movie? I can't understand the big fuzz about it. It's predictable (I know it's a book), it's sometimes boring it has bad actors and has one of the worst typical Hollywood endings I've seen. The good thing about the movie is the direction. I have always liked so it's very weird that I didn't love this. It's a good movie but not more, if it wasn't for all the production-money they had it would have been crap. This movie won 11 Oscars and was top box-office movie of the year.I give this movie 6 out of 10 (good but not more). It's my opinion and i don't want any fanboys to argue with me."
"To describe the wonder of this film. The two previous Lord of the Rings films were superb, but the final film exceeded them all. Once again, Peter Jackson tested the absolute limits of the visual effects technology. Although the film was over 3 hrs, it seemed to fly by. The Extended Version DVD added scenes were excellent as well. The horse charge of the Riders of Rohan will long be remembered as an epic work of cinematography. Behind-the-scenes news says that ove 600 horses were used in the charge. While not as scary as the Shelob scene, the ""Mouth of Sauron"" scene in the extended version was very weird and creepy. The screenplay was beautifully written and executed. This is a flawless movie."
"I asked myself ""What the heck (actually ***k) this movie is doing here in the list of Top 250 movies of all time?"". But hey this is a list decided on votes and popularity nothing to do with the quality of the film I bet as time continues its inexorable march and the movie isn't that fresh in viewers' minds it wouldn't be rated this high...but then you never know popular taste is so unpredictable.An average movie with nothing deep or thought-provoking about it. Nice special effects and scenery though. A movie of the time a blockbuster but certainly not a great one. I was very bored when I saw this movie.What the movie has going for it is the LOTR enthusiasts like Trekkies they watch/buy anything that has to to with the movie and the cult around it. I know a guy who works in the California branch of my office who has the entire set of LOTR characters as small figurines on his desk ---Insert Rolling of Eyes icon here---!!!My rating is 4 of 10"
"Come on People, How can you rate this movie as no 3 all time??? I do agree it is a very good movie based on an excellent novel or series of novels (the one I read had all three in on book). Yes it swept the academy awards (just the third one though) but where is Al Pacino, or Marlon Brando, or Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman? And to make things worse, the other 2 Movies are in the top 15!!! Don't get me wrong I did enjoy all three movies and if I sat down and made a list of my top 25 movies ROTK would probably be around 20th but definitely not top 10 or # 3 of all the movies ever made, or at least voted on in this list. I just don't think a movie should be voted one of the best of all time with no Great Actors in leading roles. Just my opinion, sorry my little Hobbit friends."
"When it comes to TLOTR:The Return of the King, I personally think that this is not such a fabulous movie. First of all I would like to comment on the acting, many of the actors in the movie is to me very dorky. Orlando Bloom seems to only got one face that he uses throughout the whole movie,this is a very lousy performance. And Viggo Mortensen only seems good because many of his scenes are along with Bloom. That I mean is that, next to Orlando Bloom even Dolph Lundgren would appear to be a Oscar candidate. Of course many of the battle scenes are great, and very entertaining to watch, but this is not enough to make this a classic movie, but of course, it will become one anyway. And much of the comedy in the movie, specially the scenes with Gimli and Legolas, are totally unnecessary. This is not successful, and one of the things that could have been changed or even left out of the movie."
"Let me first say i really am sorry for what I'm about to say because i truly know how much LOTR fans love their trilogy. Now, having said that, this movie was truly garbo and by garbo i mean garbage. I have to say that i liked the costumes, the music is great, and heck who doesn't love aragon, but please did i have to sit through that 7 hour ending between all of the little dudes and the boat trip? I don't think i should have been subjected to that. One of my friends lets call him angry mike actually thought that was the greatest ending to any movie since...well...since any movie that Bon Jovi has been in (dude loves Bon Jovi). Anyway he asked me why did i hate it so? Well thats easy. When i started the movie i was 20, when i left the movie i was 25. What is that all about? Did i gain anything in that last million hours of goodbye footage? No...well one thing...i learned that sam and froto...well they couldn't be cuter together. Wait...what? Froto and sam weren't together? Now i really hated the ending. Anyway do yourself a favor you want fantasy go and rent Krull."
"To me it's unbelievable that this movie counts as the second best movie ever made. The book(s) themselves are brilliant which means that Jackson had plenty to work with. He started out alright as far as i'm concerned; the first movie has the feel of a dark somewhat mysterious adventure. His reasons for changing from this feel to the more mainstream ""big spectacle"" feel remain a big question to me. Alright, this one's better then the second one, but i'm not sure that's that big of an accomplishment. The acting is mediocre from time to time, the special effects are great at one moment and stink the next. The scenario has a great potential, but turned out reasonable at best and to top this all: the dialogs are downright childish most of the time. All-in-all the whole movie, in my opinion, was shot way to fast. It lacks any artistic feeling."
"I have nothing against this movie, and as a matter of fact like it very much, BUT it is nowhere near the quality of story as The Shawshank Redemption and The Godfather, nor many other movies out there. This movie, while great, does not deserve as high a ranking on the Top 100 list as it has. There are many other movies out there, and while they may not have all the shiny special effects that the producers spent way too much money on, that's not all that you can base a movie on. While a great author, J.R.R. Tolkein's medium was the written word, not the movie. If you want to rate this as a book, it would definitely not appear anywhere near the top 100 or 1000 or perhaps even 10000 of all time, and should therefore not be among the top movies as well."
"WAUW!First, to everyone, who hasn't seen it yet;WHAT ARE YOU DOING?GO AND BUY IT RIGHT NOW!I think that this movie probably is the best of the three ""Lord Of The Rings""-movies! And it's just sad, that this were the last one....But then we have an great excuse, to use 9 hours to watch movies!I love all three of the movies, and I don't think it's one of those movies that you get tired of, no, it's all about watching it again, ad again, and again!Love Lærke, DK"
"In summary, this movie rocked my world. In more detail, this was the movie moment of the century, and it will take something very special to beat this in my eyes (maybe Spidey 2, who knows?)The cast were uniformly superb, all of them giving everything to their performances, creating a level of emotion and empathy not normally seen in the fantasy genre. The visual effects were absolutely stunning, with Gollum once again stealing the show for realism. This will form the benchmark for virtual characters for years to come.Peter Jackson obviously loves his craft as well as his audience. Each shot created to further the story, not to try and push your brain out of the back of your head. The narrative was realized to perfection, and it certainly did not seem 3 hours 15 minutes long.I gave this movie 10 out of 10, but only because the score only went up to 10. Whatever it was out of, this movie would have got the maximum for me."
"Purests, say what you will. A movie can NEVER be exactly true to a book; they are different mediums, with differing weaknesses, strengths and constraints. Each having it's inherent possibility for magic and greatness. This, along with the other two films in the trilogy, were as much a labour of love, passion, artistry and expression of life's work to that point for Peter Jackson as for Tolkien. I say ""Bravo!"" to him, and ""Bravo!"" to the Community that grew in creating something so fine. If only we could all find such fellowship.Shame on those who find such sport in documenting every error they find in these movies. Why remove every ounce of magic and joy involved in watching the film?P.S. If you would like to see more of the beautiful New Zealand countryside, watch 'Whalerider,' 'The Last Samurai,' or 'Sylvia.' These are just a few, released last year also."
"the LOTR's trilogy is one of the best films ever created. Since i was born i have always thought that the star wars trilogy was absolutely stupendous. unbeatable. but i believe that the LOTR's comes close i would like to thank Peter Jackson for all his efforts and hard work he put into this movie. i would not be surprised if you created another three films to tell how the ring was actually made, and how Sauron devastated middle earth. I think another three films would be great. I'm sure these 3 films will be remembered right through time. thanks for creating a brilliant set of films. My best regards. Johan"
"Many years ago I read The Hobbit and the three Rings. Afterwards I read them again. I need to do it a third time.While I admit the movie leaves out the problems confronting the hobbits when they return to the Shire, it is an excellent movie. The three movies are more than I could ever have hoped for. I cannot imagine this kind of undertaking, and I deeply am grateful for those who did it.As for the actors, I liked them all. Sean Astin was my favorite. He displayed such caring and a range of emotions that is amazing since he is not English, but is American. His superb allegiance to Frodo who sometimes rebukes him displays the fine qualities of good friendship.But for them all, thank heavens I lived to see them."
"The Return Of The King is a stunning cinematic Journey that takes us to the end of a marvelous story. The greatest trilogy ever written in my opinion and should be enjoyed in novel form as well as in cinema form. The cinematography and sets are breathtaking. the screenplay is as true to the novel as a screenplay can be, and the characters are so believable that you will swear that hobbits exist.the visual and special effects will leave you in awe. The actors were superb in their handling of the characters especially the actor who portrayed Gollum. His take on that character could not have been done more vividly If Tolkien himself had directed it. The entire trilogy is a must have for anyones collection who calls themselves a Tolkien fan or a fan of great cinema."
"Well, I've seen this movie about 3 times, twice in theatres and once on DVD.I loved it. I never read the books, but I do believe from what I've heard that the movie was very well orchestrated to bring to life the very essence of the book. I know it was a bit long, but it was worth the special effects and great acting. I myself am trying to get into the business so I know how much dedication and hard work it takes. But this movie is not for the people with bladder problems, as I said, it's LONG. But if your like me you already have the extended edition on reserve from Suncoast Video. But if you just got over seeing a horribly bad movie like Terror Toons, then this will balance out the void that the movie created."
"as a fan of both the books and the first two movies my expectations for ROTK were high, and i'm happy to say i wasn't disappointed. Peter Jackson has secured his place my list of legends, the actors were on top form and the battles and CG characters were spectacular. I was particularly impressed by Sean Astin as Samwise Gamgee. He really shone in these films, reflecting his own characters journey to become the ultimate hero of the film. Viggo Mortenson is also fantastic, giving yet another stand out performance in the final installment of Jackson's masterpiece. other aspects i should mention. Legolas and Gimili's comic duo were great again, providing us with some much needed relief from the emotion and trauma of the film. also, nice to see singing in the last film, such an important aspect of the books. in particular, Billy Boyd perfectly compliments a dramatic and moving scene with a folksy song sung beautifully. i would definitely recommend seeing this film if you've been on the moon for the last six months and failed to see it yet."
"I absolutely loved this movie. I've seen this already five times in the theater, and now I own it on DVD. And yes, I cried everytime I've seen it. This is one of the best pictures, ever. My favourite part, actually, is Eowyn killing the Witch-King, but there are many more good scenes. The acting-skills are good, everybody gave his/her heart in it. I really don't understand, how on Earth did they forget about Sean Austin at this years Oscars... Also, I recommend watching the three parts together. It may be long, but it IS NINE HOURS of MAGIC, and I mean real MAGIC. Peter Jackson and his team, lads, they really take you there, to the middle of Middle Earth. Hope, you'll have fun, at least as much as I had."
"This to me is the best of the three. Of course there is the fact that it completes the story, but the overall emotion and excitement in the storyline are amazing. The characters really mature in this one which left me with a sense of satisfaction. I loved the special effects, and you get to see some really interesting characters in this one. The special effects and the live action blend together seamlessly. You will feel like you are experiencing this with the characters. I read the Trilogy and I can't believe that someone tapped into my imagination and put it on film. The one thing I had a hard time with was knowing that this is the last one. I cried, I laughed, I gasped, I LOVED IT!!"
"Peter Jackson's vision of LOTHR is brilliant. The story takes me along with and takes me to places I've never been. The characters in this story are so unique. My favourite part of the story has always been ROTHK. The film is truly an epic. I hope that future film projects can possibly lead Peter Jackson to film ""The Hobbit"" as well. I am wondering though what ""King Kong"" will be like as well?. With the upcoming theatrical release of ROTHK and the future special edition as I well, I can truly say that I really enjoy these films (and others as well) and I would recommend that any movie fan check these out. Adding them to your collection allows you to re-visit Hobbiton once more and perhaps never leave?"
"The last 30 or 40 minutes of this film were abominable. Jackson had made so many alterations to the story throughout the trilogy that were unnecessary, that I can't believe he didn't make the necessary alteration of editing out the last two chapters of the novel. That's a bit extreme, but as a film the logical post-climax conclusion of the movie would have been the coronation of Aragorn. From here he could have had a brief montage of Shire events, then a nice visually stunning ending of Elven ships sailing away at the very end. 5 minutes, not 30.If he was going to cut something it should have been the painfully boring ending, and NOT TOM BOMBADIL!!!!-Other than that, best movie of the year, best trilogy ever, best fantasy film ever, best story to film adaptation ever, best use of CGI yet, great performances, etc. etc. etc."
"I think Lord of the Rings is the best. It is the most exciting movie in my life not to mention favorite... I play the video game a lot and every single day I can't stop thinking about Lord Of The Rings.The third part of the trilogy is the best, although I wouldn't understand it if I didn't see the first two. My favorite character is Craig Parker(Haldir), he's totally amazing even if he's not a main character. Most girls like Legolas though, but I think Haldir is better(thats just MY opiion so don't get mad) and my brother thinks Im a Lord Of The Rings geek. I've watched Lord Of The Rings Return Of The King 3 times in theaters and will probably watch it everyday if I get it on DVD I'm lucky cause I dont get to watch movies very often. I keep on thinking if Isildir (I dont know if I spelled his name right) just tossed the ring into Mount Doom then it wouldve been over.gee.. what a short movie that would be. J.R.R. Tolkien did a splendid job on his book but I like the film better. Peter Jackson is a brilliant director, it made the film come to life. I think he should create the Hobbit and other stories... I dont think there should be a sequel, it might ruin the name Lord Of The Rings and it might be horrible. (except maybe if Peter Jackson does it)I don't want Lord Of The Rings to end at the 3rd film though... I want it to continue. What about you?"
"Forget the Passion of the Christ. Religion seems to cause more harm than good and a guy being whipped pales into insignificance to the number of people mutilated, tortured, shot, stabbed and dismembered in the name of God and Allah!Now the LOTR shows the goodness in the face of adversity, it shows real faith and the rewards it can bring. It shows the human spirit at it's best. How people of difference races, religions can pull together in a time of need and how this is a far greater reward of some being that we have limited evidence exists, Even if he does the bravery, the selfless actions and the support would be worthy of God and Allah.LOTR shows more about how humanity should act than Passion of Christ, all it shows is we should feel guilt becuase God sent his son to die for us. To date I am waiting on Humanity to change their behavior as a result. I feel more inspired by the actions of the characters in LOTR than any of the murderous, corrupt indivduals in Passion of Christ (with the exception of Christ of course).Anyway had my say."
"This is by far the greatest movie trilogy ever made.I should end the comments here because that's all that need to be said. No trilogy has been so brilliant throughout.  All other major trilogies have had weak links.Star Wars had the Return of the Jedi, Matrix had a story that didn't make sense in the end and the Godfather part 3 was awful.I have never seen a film where I am care so much to what happens to a group and character and be engaged in their battles as much as this.  Never have I been through such a degree of emotions in a film.  Happiness, sadness, laughter and tears.  Peter Jackson and the crew have excelled themselves and the only bad point to the trilogy is that no matter what any of them do in the future, it will never meet the high standards set by this trilogy.Peter Jackson has made JRR Tolkien a very proud man and has looked after his baby with respect and care and for that I thank him.  People said the movie was an impossible achievement to do, but Jackson succeeded.Bring on the Hobbit and Peter Jackson's next project King Kong."
"I have been a fan of the LOTR books for over 30 years.  I use to long for a movie to be made but then realized that it would be impossible!  Then Peter Jackson came along and ""made all my dreams come true"", as Samwise would say! The trilogy of movies are wonderful.  Beautifully written, amazing to look at, cast perfectly!  I do not understand the management of this site who think it is only worth 6 out of 10.  And why is that the only person who can like the movie is a rabid fan?  I think Peter Jackson took a much loved story and made movies that are now much loved themselves.  Too long?  Not for anyone who understands what is going on in the stories!  Not long enough I say!  I can't wait for the extended version to see what was left out! All in all, I say get to the theater before it is too late!  A thing like this has not happened for an age, and will never happen again!  Enjoy the magic! Don't let a few simple minded people stop you from experiencing something wonderful!"
"Quite simply, this is the height of an excellent blending of literature and film making.  Most adaptations are either so faithful to the written material that you wonder why you bothered to go to the film or you watch the movie and wonder to where the original story disappeared.  Every aspect of this movie is a joy to experience.  The language, the beauty of the locations, the solidity of the cast and the soaring grandeur of the music combines to make a film that is largely faithful to the text and, yet, transcends the written word to bring the heart and the soul of the trilogy to life. I am amazed at how I fall into each of the films every time I watch them. It is tribute to Peter Jackson that these movies can pull us into the story and the lives of the characters no matter if you have seen the film once, twice or twenty times.  I remember thinking when the first film opened, ""Please don't let this be crap."" Not only was it not butchered, it can hopefully become the standard from which other fantasy literature can be adapted for film.  I hope that the Trilogy will be re-released periodically in the theaters because the big screen is truly the best format for watching these movies. Thank you Peter Jackson and everyone associated with the three films, for creating a moving and memorable movie experience. I am truly grateful that this happened in my lifetime."
"Although this movie shows stuff that weren't in the book, IT WOULD BE BETTER IF IT ""WERE"" IN THE BOOK! Peter Jackson is amazing and this movie is worth 20+ Oscar awards! I really recommend this movie to be watched after seeing the first 2. I really can't perceive why or how this movie has an 8.9 according to it's rating. I was shocked, i thought it would get a 10! Return of the king is my Favourite movie by far."
"PJ did it didn't he?  Frankly, I don't necessarily rate this film higher than the previous two per se.  Rather, I think the way the tale was weighted in both the book and more especially, the screenplay, lent itself to a climactic finish which this film encapsulated.  I do think the CGI in RoTK (unsurprisingly) outclassed the previous offerings though.  I understand that Weta were flat out right up to the release cut-off. My only grumble was the contrived ending.  Even though Tolkien himself seemed to have a problem finishing the original novel satisfactorily, I thought the liberties taken in the conclusion marred an otherwise perfect film.  I believe it would have been better served by placing the cut scenes of Sauron back in at the beginning, and then finishing on the crowning of the King.  A voice over with a storyboard or flashes could have covered the return to the Shire, and Bilbo's departure. That said, its a pretty minor grumble and doesn't spoil the overall enjoyment. So well done to a local lad turned good :)  With rumours that The Hobbit may now be slated for filming, I look forward to what other treats PJ and Weta can conjure."
"Although you would have to have seen parts one and two to wholly appreciate part three, Return of the King is in and of itself an exemplary piece of film-making. Acting performances are outstanding across the board, the scenery will take your breath, and the exceptionally well-adapted story will have you on the edge of your seat the whole 210 minutes.I should say Tolkien would be proud of this movie. I wouldn't have imagined most people who read the book to say that they were quite satisfied with the movie's handling of the story. The years shooting this movie were time well spent! (As will be the hours you it'll take you to watch it all. :)"
"I was a bit scared to see the trilogy, because I have read the books and loved them. I didn't want my own view dashed because of it. And after the Harry Potter incident... I wasn't too thrilled about another 'book into movie' thing.But, after much pushing, I saw it, and it was lovely! The views were amazing, the actors were magnificent, I could go on. I was a bit sad with what they left out, and changed, etc, but that was to be expected. And I am much happier with how Peter Jackson showed Elves. I had a different view, but this is much, much better.Overall, THIS movie was superb. The music, mixed with colourful costumes, brilliant images, and the fantastic script... I loved it. A must see!
But, don't bring the kiddies. I don't think you want them coming to you at about 2 in the morning talking about ghosts and spiders. I'm being attacked now by my brother, who's son has seen it. If the must see it, you should go first, then you can see if it's fit for them. If you want to see it again. I know I did.Leona"
"This is the best movie of this god damn century, funally some perfect movie which can combine all of movie categories such as horror and drama and so on,... this is the best there is.. and he deserve to be a winner, cause them all, all the other movies, just cant be such great as it..well done mr. jackson, keep doing what you do..an make more movies for us...you the best..lotr is the best, the matrix just blew it all, just blew it, and that is very bad... why ""the year of the matrix"" became all of a sudden ""the century of lord of the rings"", cause peter jackson had a vision, and that vision came true by outstanding rating, and the number of those who have seen it, this is the true king.. this trilogy, this producer, well done.. lord of the rings: the return of the king- the best of the best"
"For all those who are trying to diminish the quality and the excellence of the entire LotR trilogy, just because they're stupid or misguided : know that this IS A NEARLY IDEAL WAY of transfering Tolkien's work to a movie. In order to mention all the characters and events, The Silmarillion and The Hobbit need to be filmed, and the entire project needs to last at least 40 hours. So don't just say that it sucks,think about it. The trilogy is one of the best in the history of film making,next to Star Wars,The Godfather & Indiana Jones. So, if there are opposite opinions, please post them, and provide a good explanation why do you think it sucks."
"This movie, as with the previous two, just blew my mind.  It was the most Peter Jackson-esque of the 3, which was why I was surprised that it won the Oscar for Best Picture.  But it deserved it, despite it's flaws, which all movies have.This was the antithesis to 'the Matrix' trilogy.  Instead of starting strong and growing weaker, it truly did gain momentum with each movie.  Hell, with eachscene.  And there was an actual payoff!This is a movie you should just see to believe.  Fantastic."
"this film is overrated , the dying in the arms scenes ( a lot of them ) should have been shorter in length , the ending could have been shorteri respect jackson as a director but not an editor , also slow motion should be shot that way not slowed on an avid it looks like cheap tv effects.on the positive side new zealand has a great filmmaking history with whale rider and the piano as two of the best films from NZ , the lotr films are not bad but over rated i predict the effects in lotr will look like the old bw king kong film in as many years , lets hope jackson lives up to his oscar and becomes a better director in the future."
"Well, this was my favorite of the trilogy, mainly because it was backed up by 6 hours worth of the previous films which meant it didn't have to build as much, and what followed was 3 hours of fantastic footage. The thing is because of those previous films you already have the feeling of the immense task and the size of the situation, so practically the entire film is more dramatic than one i have ever seen. It thoroughly deserved its massive applause at the end, although whether that was so people could walk about I don't know. If there's one criticism i have, it was overly long this time, mainly in the strung out ending. Sadly, i do not complain directly to the producers, since the endings are actually necessary and it would be criminal to leave them out according to the books. Even so I did feel had the movie ended 20 minutes earlier the cheer would have been an eruption, but maybe that's a personal dislike. Nevertheless, the battle sequences deserve an academy award alone, beautifully crafted and awe inspiring to watch. Acting is up to scratch as always, and there's not a dud scene in the film.All in all, if you don't see this film you will be missing out on one of the greats the camera was invented for. This is the one ring. See it."
"Anyone who likes fantasy movies, and special effects should watch this movie. This is the only movie I have seen who's third sequel is the best of the three and who's first two installments are a must see also."
"Truly one of the greatest movies of all time.  Peter Jackson is a god among men, and needs Oscar gold more than anyone else nominated this year. Easily the best picture of 2003.  Let's hope the academy makes a good decision when handing out best picture and best director."
"Billy Boyd and Viggo Mortensen are wonderful singers. I loved every part of this movie. i really enjoyed the endings. I liked the action, adventure, and emotional status of this movie. It was truly breath taking."
"This is the best ending to the best trilogy ever!!! The whole movie is a piece of cinematic greatness. The battle scenes are wonderful and the adventure is genuine. The only problem this movie has is the very ending. I personally believe there is too much closure. I know Peter Jackson is trying to be more faithful to the books, but it is too much. We have already been sitting in the theater for 3.5 hours, we don't need another 15 minutes of closure. I think after Aragorn is crowned king and they all bow to the hobbits the movie should end. Even with the endings, this is the BEST movie of all time. I know I will be crushed if it does not win best picture at the Oscars, it totally deserves it over Lost in Translation."
"The Return of the king is one of the best movies ever made.It's the best of the three Lord of The Rings movies.The Return of The King is just a brilliant movie, nothing more nothing less.This movie just deserves to win the Academy Award for Best Picture..."
"hands down, this is the best movie i, or anyone i know, has ever seen, based on an amazing, yet until now under-rated, book series. the graphical engineering put into the special effects, are more lifelike than almost any i have seen, and make most movies, (ie. matrix revolutions) look like an 80's arcade game compared to the fmv sequences in ffX. the plot is flawless, and the script takes that to a whole new level. the casting, all but perfect, though i cant think of anyone better for any of the roles, (perfection is just unattainable on earth)."
"The last installment in the LOTR trilogy finally is here and it didn't let me down one bit.  Out of the three movies in the series, ""The Return of The King"" provides a lot of entertainment and excitement for three and a half hours (not to mention worth the price of admission)."
"All three movies, are in essence one whole movie, and  that one movie is the greatest movie ever made, brilliant casting, and executed perfectly. Kudos to all involved, it has set new standards on film making, the greatest trilogy/movie ever made."
"Well what can i say except WOW! Peter Jackson surely made us wait for the best, last. I dont know exactly what to write because i am speechless about this movie so far i've seen it 3 times at the cinema and feel i should now wait for the DVD release to see it again. I cried so much at the end from when Saroun is defeated till the end of the film! Sean Astin is outstanding in this film he really put his all into Sam aswell as Elijah as Frodo who really makes us feel for his tortured soul. And the rest of the cast were all great too, best cast line up i've seen in a film, well ever as far as i'm concerned. I also love the little hobbits Merry (Dom) and Pip (Billy) you made me laugh and cry so many times with your hobbit antics.The perfect fantasy world is middle-earth! And the magic lives on thanks to Jackson and Tolkein! and the elves, dwarves, hobbits, wizards and man."
"how can people vote for this one I dont understand, it has no political, sociological or human qualities whatsoever, it may be entertaining but its scope is more like a football game or time spent playing a video game, entertainment pure and simple.If this ever wins an Oscar it will only serve to cheapen the value of those awards, how can people pick this over Schindlers list or Sunset Blvd is beyond me.It may be good entertainment value but it will never be a classic in the classic sense."
"This would have gone down as one of the best movies ever in my book were it not for the fact that the editor forgot what it meant to ""edit"" a movie. I would like to see what actually made it to the cutting room floor.  The scenes with Sam, Frodo, and Smeagol climbing the mountain seemed like they would never end.  This should have been a 150-160 minute film."
"I loved it! I mean it is probably one of the best films i have seen. Okay, i admit that the ending kind of gets boring, but only the last 5 min. of it. I loved the battle scenes and all of the suspense. The thing that scared me the most is Gollum. He is really creepy in this movie. I also liked how it begins and how gollum gets the ring. It is soooo scary, but cool too."
"I would like to send a personal thank-you note to Peter Jackson for making this trilogy. I have been a ridiculously avid fan of this story since I was an 8-year-old girl. I'm now 22, and thank my grandmother for introducing me to a great novel. Anyway, I thought that Peter Jackson did great justice to the book. Regardless, this is a trilogy great enough to rival the holy trilogy, Star Wars."
"I was not so impressed with the first two movies.  They are good movies don't get me wrong, but I never thought they were anything special.  But ROTK just blew me away.  Everything about the movie screams class.  Come February 29th this movie must win Best Director and Best Picture.  I don't agree with many viewers who said that the ending is drawn out.  It's exactly as it should be.  I would watch this movie 10 times in a row and not get bored.  Watch it now."
"Now that this 12 hour film is complete the process of evaluating it can properly begin. It's not perfect - what is - but it's not far off. What a stunning, magnificent, accomplishment.  To all who worked on it, Praise them with Great Praise. They have created one for the Ages."
"This is the greatest epic ever, couldn't find a single this wrong with it, i just can't wait of the extended editions, so I can watch the lord of the rings in it's complete form. This is the best part of the 3 films, but together they make the STORY, they should be watched one after the other..... Note: watching them one after the other wastes much time and causes tiredness, You have been warned"
"Although as a zealous and genuine admirer of the book I can hardly say the film is satisfying enough for me, I'm bound to admit it's amid the most affecting and ""powerful"" movies ever created. Having seen the three movies, I would rather comment the whole film (with all three parts)instead of only reviewing the third movie. It's indisputably the biggest and the most professionally ever made project, whose acclaim is completely deserved. Most of us, the ""true Tolkien's admirers"", cannot accept the huge discrepancies between the film and the book, claiming the film is only a money making machine, but what we must acknowledge is the power of the film that ""suffers no rivalry"". It's plain there are three reasons for the making of the Lord of The Rings - first is money, the second is more mone and the third is needless to add. Nonetheless the power of quality cannot be denied. moreover it is worthy of being praised. Finally I'd like to express my deepest respect to Mr. Peter Jackson, no matter there are hundred of reasons I'd rip his beard off."
"I say: ""The final chapter that is ""THE LORD of the RINGS: THE RETURN of the KING"" is by far the only truly great movie of 2003! Every bit of craftsmanship, from the costume design to the wonderful acting proves that this film is THE BEST FANTASY ADVENTURE OF ALL TIME. Bravo to everyone involved in this GROUNDBREAKING, MIRACULOUS ACHIEVEMENT! Words simply can't describe the true MASTERPIECE this film really is, which is why I am naming it THE BEST PICTURE OF THE YEAR!"""
"I've seen a lot of movies, but this will go down as one of the best for me. The visual effects alone were breathtaking, but add in the writing, the actors, and the cinematography and you have a masterpiece.  Peter Jackson should take a bow for this film, though each lotr was great, Return of the King had that extra oomph. And Viggo, Sean, Elijah, Orlando, etc... were nothing short of spectacular."
"This was all around a great film. The graphics were beautiful and the acting superb. I just feel that there was something missing. I guess something didnt meet up to my expectations, but the extended version promises much more deleted scenes. Hopefully that will fullfill my needs. The second film i felt the same way so hopefully they will have more in the extended version. Above all I thought the movei was awesome and I have to give Sean Astin credit for doing what I think was the best out of all the actors. I loved his performance in the movie and hopefully hollywood will realize who the real actors are in stead of these crappy actors like colin farrel or ben affleck. I recommend this film to anyone who is into fantasy adventure type movies."
The film is great. I read all three books and Peter Jackson was very fair to the books. The cast was perfect and everything in the movies were perfect! It will be part of my DVD collection for sure. This is the type of movie that you watch over and over again and always find new interesting things in different scenes. Good job Peter and the cast!
"What can I say about this film that others haven't said a million times before in more eloquent prose?  Return of the King was beautiful and exhilarating in a way that few films are nowadays, much less huge Hollywood blockbusters such as this one.  The sheer over-powering emotion and visual grandeur of it all is, in my honest opinion, second to none. . .and now, looking at these films as a whole, I cannot for one second imagine a greater trilogy of films ever being created in this or any other dimension ever again.  The Lord of the Rings will stand the test of time as being an unrivaled cinematic masterpiece that's both bold and brilliant; magical, and yet grounded in humanity."
"the funny thing is is that I left the the first time slightly dissapointed, then when I saw it the second time I worked out why, I just wasnt capable of taking in all the subtleties and nuances in one sitting, second time around it became argubly the best film I have ever seen, and without doubt my fave.(for the record,the other arguable best film is Schlindlers List, which I MOST definetly didnt want to see a second time...)"
"It was the most mindblowing film I have ever seen at the cinema.  I left feeling so happy that my expectations had been fulfilled, and yet so sad because it was all over.   Can't wait for the extended edition, it will undisputably be the best film ever made."
"After seeing this film I realized that I had just watched what was perhaps the best movie I had ever seen.  The only way this movie could not be enjoyed is if one were predispositioned to not liking fantasy or Tolkien's writings. As a fan of the books, I could not have expected a better translation to film.  Some Tolkien purists have been unfair to all three films but I am sure the man himself would have approved. Movies do not get better than this."
"This movie is definitely one of the best movies that I have ever seen! I'm also a huge fan of Tolkien's books, and though the movie doesn't exactly live up to the books, it is a pretty darn good job. All of the acting is wonderful, and Peter Jackson is by far one of the best directors of the modern day. It's amazing of how such a wonderful book can be brought to life. This movie is just amazing...I was blown away!"
"I consider this trilogy to be one movie, as JRR Tolkien intended the books to be. This movie is an excellent adaptation of the books and it captures the spirit of them perfectly. This movie should serve as an example for all future book to film adaptations."
"This is a very good movie.  I waited a year for it, but it was definately worth the wait.  The acting is great, the effects are great, and the locations are awesome.I enjoyed the special effects, they were realistic and they didn't take over the whole movie (Think the opposite of Matrix- Although i haven't seen the last one, i have heard all of the horrible reviews it got.)The story is great, it is well written by Tolkien; and Peter Jackson did a great job of bringing it to the big screen.Overall, I would give the movie a 9.7/10 (I missed the House of Healing- I can't wait untill the extended DVD comes out because i've heard it will be on it!)"
"It seems churlish to find fault with such a visually superb film and engrossing film, but there was at least half-an-hour at the end which could really have ended up on the cutting room floor without anyone noticing. But now I feel bad for criticising the last part of what will go down as one of the finest film trilogies to be made in my lifetime."
"This was the shortest 3 1/2 hours i have ever spent and worth every dime. Wow what a wonderful movie, if there are better ones, i haven't seen it yet. Characters, story, action and soundtrack better than excellent. The attention paid to detail was incredible. Don't miss out on this fantastic film and series"
"LOTR:ROTK is without a doubt the BEST movie I have ever seen.  It transcends all genre's, before and after, to permanently leave it's timeless mark just as Tolkien's masterpiece has done.From concept to completion this movie takes all the elements of film and places them at the pinnacle of the filmaking mountaintop.  From characters to costumes, acting to cinematography, sound to editing, CGI (find a better use of SEAMLESS CGI on the market today) to screenplay, oh and music, it is hard to point to another movie that weaves all this together into a timeless masterpiece!I even cried 3 times and had to hold back about 4 more.  Kudos to Mr. Jackson and the entire cast and crew for filling my soul and mind with the visions and feelings that transcend life itself and dig deep to where many films fail to plant their seed...the soul."
"I couden't even believe that there is happening.I watched it andmy heart was bursting all the time.I thought that I'm gonna die. Especially when Frodo and Sam were on the screen.I coulden't sayanything,I wanted to cry and I did.Poor Frodo when he lost hisfinger,that was a nightmare and everything was with Sam and Frodo BURSTING HEART.AND WHEN WAS THE END OF SAURON I thought that nowcame my end,because my FEELINGS were BURSTING OUT. The Battels were amazing,ACTORS were NOBLE,NATURE WAS VALINOR. All the time when I turning on music of RETURN OF THE KING I'm starting to cry and the FEELING OF BURSTING HEART RETURNING. I want to give the score of this movie a 10000000000000000000000000000000000 I DOOOOOOOOON'T have words I'M GONNA LIVE IN TOLKIEN WORLD IN REAL LIFE Tolkien's World Is Real"
"Probably the best film I've ever seen at the cinema. Viggo Mortensen was EXCELLENT, I almost believed he was Aragorn. Peter Jackson is a LEGEND. All of the cast are a credit to Jackson. (Loved the Hobbits). Orlando Bloom..what can i say? fabulous - as ever! Ian McKellan- his best role ever. The battle scenes were spectacular, Minas Tirith was beautiful. MUST win Best Picture and Best Director at The Academy Awards and BAFTAs.Ive seen it 4 times already, and can't wait for the Extended edition DVD, then I can watch all 3 extended versions..YAY."
"Now that I've seen all three of the Lord of the Ring movies, I'd like to pass along thanks to all the people who came together to make the books a reality.  It was nothing short of amazing.  If Tolkien himself had been on the set, I don't think a better job could have been done.  The attention to even the smallest detail paid off in making the visuals so incredibly realistic in all three movies.  You could almost feel yourself there watching the struggle - but from a safe distance.The films do not in any way detract from reading the books. In fact, I find it rather nice to have actual faces and voices to put to the characters as I re-read the books again.  The trilogy will always remain a favourite of mine, whether in book form or the movies.  There were changes made to the original, but the story itself was told pretty much in its entirety.  This will undoubtedly be the benchmark for all future movies of this type for many years to come.  While the end of the movie differed greatly from the book, the story `ended' the same way.  The book ending was actually covered in Galadriel's mirror so nothing was really left out or lost."
"Well, I gave this movie 10 (excellent) but I actually don't mean that it is excellent. I mean, it is simply the best movie that's ever made. It is brilliant, fabilous, supreme and simply just good. I don't think I ever will see a movie that is better than these 3 movies."
"Apart from the ending which I don't totally understand and is a bit too happy-ending-like, I thought this film was an absolute joy to watch. While I keep thinking about the visual effects in films like the Matrix, I did not have this feeling watching ROTK. For me, the technical aspects and the story were in a perfect symbiosis and showed us how films in the future will probably look like. Way to go Peter Jackson!"
"PETER JACKSON DID IT, he made the movie of the century.  Never thought that the Lord of the Rings could possibly be made into a movie that did it credit. Peter Jackson proved me wrong.All the actors, designers, music makers, custom makers, CGI experts, all need to win at the Oscars.  If Hollywood (Judges of Oscars) do acknowledge this great feat in moviemaking there is something terriably wrong with their opinions."
"The Lord of the Rings trilogy has sealed it's spot as the greatest story ever told. In the final movie of the trilogy there is an excellent mix of action, story, and closure. I can only describe the movie as beautiful. The cinematics are beautiful. The mix of visual and special effects blend perfectly. There is even a bit of humor mixed in, mostly between Gimley and Legolas."
This installment of one of film histories greatest series is truly an engaging & deeply felt epic. More character driven than the previous two films in the series this film delivers a sparking end to a GREAT TRILOGY!!!
the journey is now complete and what an adventure ... I have not read the books and thank GOD for that cause I did not want to have a biassed opinion... whether PJ et al get recognised or not (in my opinion they should get the nod for BP & BD) for me they've accomplished something very special and I think it will be some time before something like this is ever repeated or attempted ... take a bow PJ et al - BRAVO
"If anyone was to say anything negative about this movie, they either haven't seen it or they are angry Harry Potter fans. The Return of the King is just a beautiful masterpiece of a film. Hats off to Peter Jackson, as this movie is wonderfully directed. Return of the King is the most character driven and most emotional of the three films, and the actors portray the spirit of the moment exceptionally. The action sequences are compelling and exciting. This movie also has one of the greatest screenplays I have come across in years. Return of the King is also a wonderful blend of CGI and actual models and such. Overall, this movie scores a 10/10 in my book."
"Finally the end a a trilogy,three conceited boring films(call videogames maybe is better) where I never feel grip. Any boring steps are expand and other summarized..a movie son of marketing that have no soul and In the name of marketing will be overrated! Fan of good cinema Keep Away,it doesn't deserve all that kind of attention..."
"Return of the King has much in the way of special effects but little in the way of passion. The characters are flat with most serving as interchangeable placeholders. Does anyone care when Aragorn is crowned? Was anyone really terrified (or even mildly disturbed) by Sauron -- I mean his legendary evil is only the driving force behind the plot. I could go on and on. I eat my words. Apparently, Jackson lacks the emotional depth required to give Tolkien his due. Compare the monotonous drone this film is to the roller coaster ride that was Empire. Recall the impact when Vader and Luke battled and Vader announced he was Luke's father. Twenty-five years from now what will anyone remember about Return of the King? For me ROTK is long on foreplay and short on orgasm. The high point being Eowyn in drag defending her father from the wraith -- which, in any case fell down and died obligingly in front of her. This is Disney-fied Tolkien and it utterly lacks the magic of the books. ROTK may be a good movie, perhaps even a ""7"" but I found it emotionally bland and overlong."
"In my opinion, The Return of the King is the best movie of the history. The cast, the history and the special effects are great. Peter Jackson did an amazing job. I feel really grateful that The Return of the King has finally been considered by critics as the best movie of the year. However, I think that the critics should have nominated at least an actor of the movie. Sir Ian Mckellen and Sean Astin did a great job and they should have been nominated. I am really expecting the release of The Return of the King DVD, so I can have that amazing story in my hands"
"There's a lot to cover on this film, since it is 3 1/2 hours long with A LOT happening. First of all, the photography of the sights is nothing short of superb. The acting is powerful, aspecially Sean Astin's, the battles are true epic scale, and the story is excellently told. I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys 'The Lord of the Rings' or other fantasy works."
"This ponderous, disappointing conclusion to the Lord of the Rings needs to back to the edit room. The film moves along like director Peter Jackson had all of this film footage and couldn't decide what to do with it.If I didn't know better, I'd think that the producers thought they had a built in audience for LOTR, so they didn't have to work very hard to finish the trilogy. Shame!"
bar none the greatest movie i have ever seen.  i have been looking forward to this movie since december of 2002 and i was not disappointed.  the only thing that i can complain about is that the trilogy is over and i have nothing to look forward to next december!
When I came to the movie theater I had high hopes for the last installment of LOTR. I was not at all disappointed!!! It was a masterpiece and it was so intense that I actually had to remind myself to breath!! I love how in the theater their swords are bigger than your heads. The cast was so powerful in their acting that you had emotions about all of them. I LOVE this movie and highly recommend it if you've seen the first two!!
"I didn´t like this movie, because it´s story is pretty much based on Clichés, and the target for it are children with 14 yrs - less. While the photography, the music and the especial effects are really good, the acting (if there was any) and the history itself are plain lame. I can´t understand why it´s so overrated, there isn´t really anything that good on this flick..."
yes well sadly the journey must come to and end.I love these movies. They are amazing. All of the details are just so well put together. The actors do an excellent job portraying Tolkien's characters. But by far Return of the King was my favorite out of the 3. I loved the action sequences the best because it gives off so much energy. well I am so very sad that its all over but it was worth it. these movies will live on forever.
"This was totally the best movie of the three. No bomb though, they saved some goodies to the last movie. If every movie had been made like that, I would have to live in the movies. It's grandios battle-scenes made me get quite a few goosebumps. But thats my sign that the movie is good ;) I do like the book better, and they could have used prince Imrahild. But it's a movie, I can't complain. It's the best fantasy/action if those two can be combined, movie I've ever seen."
"I know its not necessary for a movie to be honest to its book but when it is, the praise that comes its way is well earned. The closest of the 3 movies to the book, it was the finale that closed an epic. Sequels are never easy to make (ask Lucas about it) since comparisons are inevitable but this movie surpassed expectations and came on the very top. Ofcourse there are reasons for it. Firstly, there already was a script, and secondly, the 3 movies were shot together. For those of us who had read the book, the charm was to enjoy its implementation and for those who belong to the 'other half of the English speaking world who are yet to read the book', it was a mystical story told with some spectacular special effects.This is the trilogy that makes everything ever on cinema look small and the finale deserves to be the numero uno film till date."
"This was the worst movie of the trilogy. Don't get me wrong, it was still a good movie, but there were some cornball lines, too predictable plot points (even if you haven't read the books), and I felt that the ending was too dragged out. The action sequences were definitely one of the best offered up by Hollywood though. Still, all that action cannot match the magic in the first movie. 8 out of 10."
"This movie, Lord of the Rings:  The Return of the King, is the greatest movie ever. I enjoyed the other two LOTR movies, but lets face it...ROTK just rocks! I thoroughly enjoyed the action in this particular film because it included humor...WELL DONE!"
"A great film with an amazing cast and astounding production.  Its so easy to believe that the film was shot in Middle-Earth with real elves, nazgul and volcanos.  Certainly one of the best movies of all time. If you haven't see it yet, make it the next movie you see."
"You would think that there is no way to top ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" and ""The Two Towers"" , but Peter Jackson continues to amaze!In the DVD of the Two Towers, Elijah Wood warned us all to ""expect MORE"" and WOW did they deliver!From both a Tolkien fan's point of view and as an avid movie goer... this movie is awesome!!!"
"I have no idea why people freak out with this movie and vote it to #3 already. It's the worst part of the trilogy by far, it never finds its rhythm, the special effects are flawed, the music is overdone and it's boring. It really looks like a 6hr movie cut down to 200mins by some guy who has no idea at all of storytelling. Parts that must be short are overlong, others are way too short which could need some explanation. No character developments at all, hints at stuff that doesn't appear anywhere in the movie (confrontation of the witchking and gandalf for example) and a heap load of boredom really spoiled my experience. It looks like a 3hr trailer for the extended edition."
"Appart from the fact the end feels a bit rushed this has to be the best of the three. Loose ends, and obviously cut scenes (Frodo and Sam walking in orc gear. The movie holds it all together.... now we wait for Peter Jacksson to do DUNE"
"The bottom line is this....for all the nitpicking about this movie, for all the minor complaints that a person might have, a movie couldn't be more perfect than this movie. Return of the King is a movie dream come true for me."
"There is nothing to comment on this film that hasn't already been said, which is simply due credit to the producers and directors of this masterpiece: this is one of the greatest films of all time, and a perfect end to what has been an unprecedented journey of filmmaking."
"Lord of The Rings: The Return of the King; the third chapter and final chapter of the epic trilogy. It was a good movie. Not a great one. At times it was a bit melodramatic and trite. I encourage people to see it, but Top 20 of all time worthy? -lets not kid ourselves. Didn't I see this sceene in LoTR 2?"
"i just came home from the cinema and i'm still crying...... this movie got everything i ever wanted to see in a movie. it is so beautiful that even i (25 years)is crying like i never cried before. peter jackson did a VERY nice job with this one, it is superior to the first and the second lotr, and those are also THE BEST ever made.thank you peter jackson, this is the kind of motivation everyone needs, these are the kind of feelings everyone is living for. i wish i could ever meet you for making such an astonishing movie.10000 out of 10thanks............"
This is the culmination of the GREATEST story ever told put to film.  I read and saw previews of what the last installment was going to be.  I saw in the extended editions how Peter Jackson said that this would blow the other 2 movies out of the water.  I did not expect this installment to be beyond even the praises of even the directors' comments.  The perfect ending to the best trilogy ever made or will be made.  I feel sorry for anyone trying to make another trilogy and come close to being this good!!!  I do not believe it can be done!!!
"Peter Jackson is a Wizard among Directors. He will win best director and best picture Oscars if not the oscars will be no more than gold statue reprenting evrything that doesn't mean sh""t and will snub all those in charge. This One is better than the other two combined Great Job Cast Crew and support People."
I rarely give movies perfects but this movie had a full gamut of emotions at my disposal. The only complaint I had was the long ending. This movie will be known from years to come as a cinematic achievement. Lastly I wished they had Eowyn/Faramir relationship but I understood why Peter Jackson decided not to put this in. Bravo to the whole Lord of the RIngs team and come oscar time I expect them to sweep
"The directing and editing are still so bad. Better than before, but it's always a big deception. Jackson have no sens of space, proportion, he don't mind of his character. The entire problem with The lords of the ring ""trilogie"", it's everything are shot at the size of the book, and never at size of the history or the characters. There's no ""point of vue"", we never passing trough the eyes, the heart, soul or passion of the characters.The great saga what i would like so much to see is never come. This is just an adaptation, not cinema."
"Having just got back home from seeing the Return of the King I can honestly say I have seen the ending to the greatest trilogy in the history of cinema.The Return of the King does what so many trilogies have failed to do, and that is to have the final installment be the best of the three.  Finishing the trilogy on a high note making you feel as if you have come to the end of the greatest journey of your life.One of the greatest films of all time 10/10."
"Peter Jackson has done us proud by bringing in this fantastic trilogy with a brilliant, heart-warming and faithful third film. I had a few worries, especially after hearing that Christopher Lee's scenes had been cut, but for me this was definitely the best of all the films. The bits that had to be cut seemed logical, and I don't think there was anything really important missed out. My only concern is that people who haven't read the book won't really understand why the Denethor (Steward of Gondor and Boromir and Faramir's father) character is the way he is, but I'm sure that will be cleared up in the extended DVD version next Christmas. Having been slightly disappointed by the way the Matrix panned out, more because the long wait built up anticipation which it really couldn't deliver on, I'm really pleased that LOTR has been consistently good. The only problem is though - what do moviegoers have to look forward to now?Lisa"
A film I've been looking forward to for as long as I've been looking forward to this one very rarely meets expectations.  RotK exceeded everything I expected and beat everything I'd hoped for.  I could not find a bad thing to say about this film.  If you enjoyed the other two you will love this one. I would have turned round and watched it again if they would have let me.
"There are some cases where a three hour movie is a good thing.  There are other times when you don't even realize a movie was three hours long. This is not one of them.  Especially when the last half-hour of the movie is extremely slow sappy wrap-ups.  At the end there were three or four points where everyone in the audience thought the movie was finally over, only to have a loud sigh fill the theater to find another wrap-up scene.  There were also numerous scenes in the middle of the movie that were of the slow dramatic variety.  That is all well and good normally, but there were too many and each was too drawn out and they helped bloat the total length (and seeming length) of the movie.Aside from that gripe, the rest of the movie overall was pretty good. The scenery was amazing, and for the most part the visual appeal was very good. The ogres and orcs and trolls were even more ugly than before and the battle scenes were on an epic scale.  The acting was pretty good, outside of the dramatic speeches.  There are some actors who should not be allowed to make troop rallying speeches and they all had such speeches in this movie."
"To keep it short and simple, only 2 movies all time where better than The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King: Godfather, and Casablanca.  The graphical effects where amazing as was the screenplay, I could have asked for no better way to end that series than with a movie like that."
The Lord of the Rings cast and crew have already set a new standard in movie production. 2003 will forever be known as the year of Tolkien and one of the greatest movies and certainly THE greatest trilogy of all time is complete.
"Somewhere in the ""trilogy"", this book lost it`s content and became an action movie like Terminator or Rambo.  Okay, so they do have some really good animations and fighting scenes, but is it really what Lord Of The Rings is about?"
"As can be expected by anyone who has read the books, The Return of the King is the most impressive and awe inspiring film of the entire trilogy. Purists will be pleased at how closely ROTK follows the book and everything that has been changed is for the better.  Some elements are left out in favor of saving time, however most of these scenes will be given back to us in the exended edition."
"What an absolute masterpiece. This is by far the BEST trilogy film series ever made - no - make that the three best FILMS ever made! All the hard work from an awesome cast and a heavenly-sent crew have left this third and final instalment of PJ's masterpiece cemented in my memory as the greatest!  You know how you always talk about how your point of view of a film has changed over the years?  And how there was always one film that you enjoyed actually watching at the cinema as well as afterwards on DVD/Video?  Well - I now have three films that I can proudly proclaim I have remembered being at the cinema to watch, have enjoyed the whole process (waiting, researching, watching, gossiping afterwards and then purchasing for home viewing!) and will cherish forever! May there be: Oscars all around! Content audiences all around! And continuing successful careers for ALL the cast and crew of all three films all around! :) Peter Jackson et al. : You are truly gifted, talented and worth every bit of your being here on Earth! And to J.R.R. Tolkien, for making this magical world of yours available for all to experience in the first place, Thank you."
"Three thumbs up. This is the best of the three films and certainly worth getting an Oscar for as best picture. There aren't words to describe this movie, but I can say one thing... move over George and Steven, there's a new kid in town that really knows how to put together a great film. The torch has now been past. But this is just my opinion."
"I was throughly engrossed by this magnificent epic and  was actually glued to my seat for the entire length of the film! Even though  there were three endings, I didn't want to say good bye to the fantastic group of characters that I had come to care about. I look forward to seeing it again."
"i cant even put into words how much i loved this movie.  This is the reason i go to movies.  This film made me run the whole gamut of emotions.  I laughed, i cried, i was scared, i felt everything.  This was one of my best film experiences ever.  You must see this movie.  I really hope this gets the awards it deserves.  Sean Astin must get best supporting actor, Peter Jackson deserves best director, and both Ian Mckellen and Viggo Mortensen should get nominated for best actor.  There are no better words to say then GO SEE THIS MOVIE.  I am going to see it as many times as i can, because this is one of the best, if not the best movies of all time"
"Well, this was stunning to say the least, for i've never seen a movie filled with more gaps than this one, and i kid you not. IMHO P.Jackson should keep true to the story if hes actualy gonna use or even walk by the name Lord of the Rings, and not put in half-rubbish quests and tales, remove the most vital parts.Well, enough said about that, the movie has gaps, ok.However, there are some positive sides in the movie too, the camera angles, the light settings and the composision principles are followed up with great accuracy and care, Filmaticaly, id say this movie is the greatest ever made, but considering the story, its rather a show-off for the new technology lurking around.Hopefully the extended edition, or the ""rumored"" ""Directors Uncut Edition"" will be better and fill in the huge gaps in the story, but i have my doubhts.Imho, the movie should be called ""Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings"" [Based on Tolkien's master piece ""Lord of the Rings""]"
"This movie is the best!  This is the movie to end all others!  This movie is now the standard all other movies will be compared to, forever. It is so good, I don't know what else to say about it."
"You can't say much more about this film then the above two words. The best of the three films sure enough, but it would have been anyway probably. Not having read the books I cannot comment on its closeness to the written text but as the final installment of the best movie trilogy ever it couldn't have been better."
"This is by far the most beautiful, entertaining and touching movie I've ever seen. There is only one disadvantage, there will be not be another Lord of the Rings movie next year :'(Score 10/10"
"If this movie is not a 10 out of 10 (excellent) then I don't know what you have to do to get one?  Peter Jackson has produced a final piece to this trilogy that is every bit as good as the first two movies and then some. All the major plots and stories from the book are included and the cgi is simply breath-taking.  I loved it.  if you like the book you'll love this movie!  Thank you Mr Jackson, now dust off your suit and go and pick up those Oscars."
"Peter Jackson's epic comes to an end with the character building of Citizen Kane, the action sequences of Spartacus, the special effects of Star Wars, and  a masterful musical score, this truly is one of the best movies ever made."
"This movie is fantastic, while it differs from the book slightly which is disappointing to Tolkien purists, the movie delivers on every aspect expected with brilliant directing from Peter Jackson and excellent acting from the entire cast and the extraordinary creation and animation of Gollum. Credit must go to the WETA team who made this movie so realistic and detailed. Some people may say the ending tends to drag on a while, but it raps up everything very well. This is a brilliant stand-alone movie, as well as a truly great ending to a magnificent trilogy."
"This movie ended the Trilogy perfectly. This is either the best trilogy ever or the best 9 hour movie ever. While each movie left me extremely satisfied, especially after 3 hours, I think the continuity of the storyline makes it more like a long movie.The Return of the King was very much like the first 2 except that it somehow managed to push the intensity and the fighting to greater levels, and kept the storyline riveting. Now, grant it, Peter Jackson had a great story to with which to work, but how he kept his vision alive and thriving was phenomenal.The cast as a whole had an unbelievable chemistry, which was key to the success of the movie. The dialogue was as good as any movie. Much was said of the long ending, but a 10 hour movie requires an extensive and comprehensive epilogue. Ultimately and totally satisfying.
Oh, one other thing, if the Award Shows don't acknowledge this one, they will lose much credibility."
"This is filmhistory being shown in our time, it shall not be lost or forgotten... Stunning cinematography. The story of Tolkien as told by PJ. Just look at the Olifanten running through the screen. Who thought that was possible?"
"This trilogy truely has to be one of the all time greats!After seeing the first two, more times than most, I was waiting with anticipation for the third installment! And what I saw was beyond my wildest expectations! An absolute gem, that everyone simply has to see, and as for Peter Jackson, well the Oscars in the bag baby!!!"
"Brilliant movie!! Just like the other 2, 'The lord of the rings, The return of the king' is a true masterpiece! Brilliant music, acting and everything else there is to mention in a movie. Though there is one thing that has annoyed me through all 3 films. Arwen! Being played by Liv Tyler has done the charakter of the Elven-lady no good. But that is of course only my opinion! Back to the actual point, I only have one comment left: If you haven't already, you should see this movie. It's worth every penny!"
"Although this film was QUITE lengthy, I found it to be the most satisfying of the trilogy. It ended this story wonderfully, and there was no question that this was the last. Even though my butt was numb, it was well worth it.. A MUST SEE FILM. These are the ultimate movies of this generation...."
"This was one of the greatest movies I've ever seen. I think that this was the best of the 3 movies. No question that so far, this is the movie of 2003-2004 season. I don't think that it could be be better. it was a favorite among nerds and non-nerds alike. and when you make a movie like that. you've truly made something for the ages"
"Through all the suffering and sacrifice,.....one moment especially stands out for me.  The serene look on Frodo's face at the Grey Havens, he will finally have peace. For all of us who took the journey with him, at last all is well with the fourth age."
"There are other movies that I will watch more often than LOTR:ROTK, but I don't think  any of them are actually better. This movie does an amazing job of completing the cycle of the trilogy while still being  its own movie.  It stands on its own merits. If you know the basic story of the first two movies of the series without actually having  seen them, I am confident that you would be able to follow the movie quite well anyway.If you have seen the first two parts of the trilogy, you'll love how certain bits of ROTK tie  into them. This thing is a '10'"
"Advertising, advertising, advertising and there is no contents. Nothing new than Star Wars - Return of the Jedi. Horrible commercial trash."
"As i read through the comments i see all sorts of people geeks, fantasy-haters, dumbasses who couldnt understand the plot, chick flick lovers and so forth.all i gots to say is this is the best movie ive seen in a long time for the first time ever i saw people give the movie a standing ovattion in the cinema at the ghettho areaits isnt the perfect filmbut its the best ever"
Talk about saving the best until last.  This final instalment rounds off the trilogy to perfection.  Traditionalists may bemoan the omission of certain minor characters and events but the film nevertheless manages to brilliantly convey the philosophy of the story and its emotional and dramatic conclusion. 10 out of 10.
"ABSOLUTELY!!!!  Peter Jackson should win Best Director and I'm guessing this film wins Best Picture.  I've seen it's biggest competitor ""Cold Mountain"" and there is no contest.  Don't hold your breath for acting nominations however, this film is too much of an ensemble piece to garner any."
"Cutting to the chase, I am not a fan of the book and will admit to not having read a single page of Tolkien in my life.  This puts me in the position of being able to judge the film not as an adaptation but as a cinematic experience in its own right, and to this extent the film is far from being the classic that most claim it to be. Strip away the mind blowing SFX and you are left with a movie which is absolutely predictable from start to finish, a lead actor who on many occassions persists on annoying the hell out of me with his overly camp glances at his best mate, a fight scene that to the uninitiated seemed rather too similar in plot (SFX again excepted) to the battle scene in the previous film, and that ending........why? I would have rated this film an 8 if it wasnt for the fact that it delivers possibly the most disappointing half hour of cinematic history at the end. Slushy? Cheesy? Fluffy? Call it what you will, but it was cringingly bad and caused me to leave the theatre thinking ""thank Jehovah it eventually finished"" - never a good sign. A landmark piece of moviemaking, yes, but will I have cause to watch this in 15 years time when the SFX have been improved upon? I think I will be quite able to find a better way of spending half a day. 6/10"
"This is the stuff that miracles are made of. Every scene bursting with outstanding feast to the eye. I never thought that Peter Jackson could pull this off, but he has and how ! This trilogy surpasses even my wildest dreams and is by far the strongest contender for best movie Oscar."
It was kinda sad watching this movie because I knew that this would be the ending for the 'Lord of the Rings'. This movie sums up everything from the first two movies. Everything was great- from the acting to the special effects. The only thing that disappointed me was that the Faramir/Eowyn love story was not included.
Wow! The special effects were awesome. The story line was 99% true to the book. I was exhausted when I left the theater not from the length of the film but from the magnitude of its content. A lot of information to digest!
"Might be the first movie that I have seen that both my friend and I had a lot of trouble answering when asked ""how was it?"".  Finding a word from a huge list of positive reactions to describe it in the short manner that is to often expected is not a pleasant task.It is most definately POWERFUL, among so many other things."
With the first two films being of such a high standard an ending to the quest had to be master piece in order to not disappoint.  And that is exactly what it was from start to finish.  A great film which definitely rates as one of the best of all time.
"Okay, can we finally acknowledge that Andy Serkis has crossed into a new area with his contribution the final two films of this trilogy and at least give him an Oscar nomination?  Either something in a traditional category or some special recognition is certainly due."
"What else is there to say. This movie is just perfect. I could bore you with a lot of praise, but I'm not going to. Peter Jackson, make space for the Oscar at your mantlepiece. Cause if there's anyone who deserves it, it's you. And Sean Astin should get one as well for best supporting male part."
"One of the best of all-time, if not THE best.  Absolutely amazing.  Better than the first two movies, by FAR.  Should be Best Picture winner at Oscars and at Golden Globes.  I'd sit through it again and again and again."
"This movie was a decent piece of entertainment for the most part, right up until the ring gets destroyed...then we have to sit through seemingly endless series of ""goodbye"" vignettes. the most offensive of these is the scene on the dock where everyone is looking at one another for 10 friggin minutes.to people who go see this movie: ONCE THE RING DISAPPEARS, YOU SHOULD TOO! -- you can leave after the ring sinks into the lava, 'cause there's not much worth watching after that.6/10 'cause the ending made me really cranky!"
"In the old days when Ben-Hur and Cleopatra came out, they were over three hours and you got an intermission in the middle to relax and regroup. That's what LOTR3 needed! The human mind can only watch drama for so long, no matter how cool it may look. There is a limit. I loved this film. I said ""wow"" out loud many times during it, but the end, my god the end!!! Arrggghhhh!!!! It just goes far beyond what humans are capable of tolerating! It took too long for them to get up mount Doom, there were too many Orcs and the dramatic conflicts just repeated themselves. LOTR 1 - 10/10 LOTR 2 - 6/10 LOTR 3 - 7/10"
"A bit too long - no need for this movie to be the 3 1/2 hours it was. The first two films were so good, we know this one could have been edited down to under 3 hours!  Minor changes in the plot, but basically true to Tolkein's essense.  Top-notch action scenes, superb graphics, one of the best films of 2003!"
"An epic movie that I feel should go down as one of the best in our time. A movie that takes you on an inspirational journey and touches your heart.Marvelous acting, directing, special effects--a proper conclusion and closure to a awesome 3 part epic. Words cannot describe this movie or do it justice, but surreal, inspirational, tear jerking, beautiful are some that comes to mind.When watching this movie, you go thru a range of emotions. Every one of them makes you feel a part of something special. A movie that transcends time, you wish it would never end.Thank you to all of the cast for making such a masterpiece. I feel honored to have viewed it and allowed to feel a part of it. You should be commended for all your hard work and every person in that film deserves an oscarMatt"
"Well, we are at the end of the trilogy. And what an end it was. Stayed true to the book every minute. I've never looked at 3 films the way I have looked at these 3. How did they do it? Would they do it again? Say whatever you want about these or any other trilogy for that matter, but this murders every other one (especially Star Wars-Lucas doesn't hold a candle to Tolkien). I think the end is best left unsaid. Brilliant from start to finish, enough said, no more to say...."
"Although I felt this movie was great on a lot of levels (great acting, great scenic vistas, great battles, etc.), the problem of the overblown ending took the wind out of it sails. I guess trying to be as true to the book as possible did it in for me, otherwise I would have rated this much higher."
"This movie was absolutely fantastic - until it went on too long.  The ending was seemingly eternal because it just wasn't that good.  I have sat through longer movies and enjoyed them.  It wasn't the length that bothered me, it was the content of the end.  I was prepared to vote it a 10, but alas a 9 is what it gets.  And I am sorry for that because the first three hours were pure magic."
"What a great end to Tolkien's adventure story. I as a reader of the Lord of the Rings am greatly satisfied by the hard work and great performances the actors as well as Peter Jackson have made. Though the movie cuts parts of the book, the story still is whole and nothing is cut without good reason. The endings at the movie aren't dragging at all like others believe. The movie had to end all the stories of all the characters. A Great Opus from Peter Jackson. One of the Greatest movies of all time.... NO DOUBT!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"The movie is mostly a sequence of events with each bluntly announced before it occurs. I did not read the book so I had no idea what was going to happen, but at no point was I surprised. No twists in this one.After 6 hours of the previous 2 movies, I would expect I would familiarize with characters and actually give a f*** about them, but they were all way too one-dimensional even after another 3 hours.It would have been an OK movie if it wasn't for the incredibly cheesy, homo-erotic and, worst of all, overloooong long ending.6/10."
"I love the enire triolgy.  If you have not seen the extended version ofpart 2, you must.  It is extraordinary!  Return of the King, in myopionion, is among the best movies I have ever seen.  The triologyin whole is the best cinema event of my life.  I believe to date thebest thing ever done."
"If this movie had been edited to 2 1/2 hours it would have been a fine film. As it was.. The Return of the King was much too long, full of scenes that were much too long, redundant returns, and long and wistful glances over and over again. If this movie had been a pizza it would have been an extra-large anchovy, with hamburger, onion, garlic, sausage, mangoes, tomatoes, potatoes, strawberries, munster cheese, cheddar cheese, swiss cheese, apple slices, peaches, salmon and extra thick applications of oregano and pepper.  In other words... too much and overdone. A great story, but poor execution, and the shame of it is.. there obviously were few if any budget constraints.  A classic example of how less can indeed, be more.."
"This was really a great movie.  It had everything you could ask for in a film. If someone said they didn't like it, then take away their movie pass and let them watch the Ya, Ya, Sister Club on DVD.  Having said all that, what was with the last ten minuets of everyone looking at each other, was there some kind of telepathy going on that I can't hear? Or was that just super sapp?"
"The ending of this movie just went on and on....very boring, plus the begining was very slow as well.Many Star Wars rips...Elepants = AT Walkers in Empire.....kings death vaders death in ROTJ (""you have already saved me!"")....good movie, but not great!!"
"I don't know what I can say about this movie that has not already been said. This movie was very profound, and one that I look forward to seeing again many times at the theatres, and owning the DVD.It's an incredible story of adventure, fantasy, and love.  It's a perfect climactic ending to a story told in three parts.10/10"
"I saw LOTR:ROTK last night at the midnight show and I can honestly say that it was the best 3+ hours I've spent in a movie theatre in recent memory.From the opening scene to the closing credits, the movie flowed well and kept the viewer's attention throughout.  I went in fully expecting to fall asleep at least once(not usually being one to sit for 3+ hours) but I was emersed in this film.  The storytelling of Peter Jackson is on display here in all it's glory.  I can't recommend this film enough!!  I don't want to spoil the story for those who haven't seen it yet,everyone should experience this one on their own. One last thing...Samwise Gamgee is DA MAN...um...er...HOBBITT!!!   10/10"
"Having seen all three movies at my local cinema tonight (the last one starting at 00:01 sharp), I can only describe this film as pure eye-candy. It delivers from start to end with stunning battlescenes (a lot more than in the previous two movies), deeply involving characters and beautiful scenery.It takes a very special person to be able to enjoy a 3 1/2 hour movie after just having seen Fellowship... and Two Towers, but this was not a problem here. I have never seen an audience so stunned.10 out of 10."
"It went til 3:30 AM but that didn't matter.  It was quite exciting (and terrifying, where's the R rating I wonder?) and carried a lot of emotional weight.  Elijah Wood shows his true capabilities as an actor in the latter half of this film, expecially at Mount Doom.  The 3 hour+ running time may numb your bum but not your attention."
"The movie does the book justice. It has everything one can ask for in a movie; excitement, friendship, loyalty, action and a story which proves that even the smallest person can change the course of the world.Lord of the Rings: Return of the King is one of the greatest movies ever made!!!"
"just back from the european premiere, and - don't wanna spoil it for others who haven't seen it. just so much: don't expect to be blown away, and you will be very, very satisfied. personally i liked ""two towers"" much better. i think rotk could do with 20 minutes cut and it would be perfect. it should have stopped at the end, and not gone on and on for another 20 minutes. but let me tell you: the fist 15 minutes of rotk  - the story of gollums origin - is the best and most intense bit of the triology."
"and so we come to the final part, and what a part it is, for three and a quarter hours you experience every emotion, you are on the edge of your seat, and you see scenes in a film you have never seen before. the acting from the spot on ensemble cast is without flaw, the look the direction, the music i can go on and on.  a film/story with real heart and courage, and with a depth that nothing i have seen recently comes close to.  forget super heroes forget matrixs this is back to real cinema with characters that you care about who matter 10 out of 10 for jackson and the cast and crew of an out and out masterpiece"
"Well I must say this movie is above anything I could have imagined no matter how high my expectations were.  Managing to see a special screening of the most anticipated movie of the year, I realized about 20 min.  in that I was in for the time of my life with this most exceptional movie.  I just cant give enough praise to Peter Jackson for not making this another matrix revolutions. Which could have happened, but thanks to the dedication of so many people instead I truly see it as the best movie so far this year just ahead of The Last Samurai. What do both movies have in common with each other?  Both are epics, both have unbelievable set designs, and both have excellent quality acting, but what makes rings even better is the sometimes happy, sometimes sad, and sometimes gut retchingly awful moments that truly bring tears to your eyes as various people die that you have become so close with during the last couple movies.  If this movie does'nt win best picture, and best director along with at least 5 more awards i'll be extremely disappointed.  This I believe is the movie that gives hollywood hope for the future!"
"My God. I was shocked after watching this movie. I cannot even imagine someone can adapt the novel so well that you will become part of it . The greatest cinematic achievement ever.This is and will be the top No. 1 favorite movie of mine all time . I could proudly say, I lived in the time of the LOTR movie made. I lived to watch this Epic saga ."
"Best Trilogy Ever
Awesome Awesome Awesome (with 3 WOW) :)
Maybe The Last Movie Won Every Awards Nominated
The Words Are too Cheap to Explain This"
This movie is the best ending that The Lord of the Rings could ever have. I watched it today and i am just impressed about it. Masterpiece!!My rating 10/10
"A surprisingly faithful adaptation of the novel. What viewers take away from this legendary adventure will depend to some extent on whether they've read Tolkien's classic novels. Lacking the context of the entire trilogy, Fellowship leaves many questions unanswered. There's also uncomfortable ambiguity in the area of spiritual content. Much of that gets ironed out as the saga continues, but families who have read the books will benefit from an even richer view of Tolkien's fantasy."
